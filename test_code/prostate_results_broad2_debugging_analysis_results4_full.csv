However, the consistency between the identified cell type (oligodendrocytes) and the provided markers is questionable given the tissue type (prostate).\n\n2. **Biological Context**: The annotation suggests that the most likely cell type is oligodendrocytes, which are myelinating cells in the central nervous system. This is inconsistent with the tissue type provided (prostate). Oligodendrocytes are not typically found in the prostate, which raises significant doubts about the accuracy of this annotation.\n\n3. **Mixed Cell Type Consideration**: While the markers do suggest a neural crest or nervous system origin, the presence of multiple markers associated with different cell types (e.g., neural crest cells, neurons, oligodendrocytes) suggests a potential mixed population. However, the annotation does not address this possibility adequately.\n\n### Suggested Alternatives or Areas for Re-evaluation:\n1. **Re-evaluate the Tissue Context**: Given that the tissue type is prostate, consider cell types that are more commonly found in the prostate, such as epithelial cells, stromal cells, or immune cells.\n2. **Investigate Mixed Populations**: Given the diversity of markers, it is possible that the cluster represents a mixed population of cells. Further analysis should be conducted to determine if multiple distinct cell types are present.\n3. **Cross-reference with Prostate-specific Databases**: Utilize databases and literature specific to prostate tissue to identify more appropriate cell types based on the provided markers.\n\nIn summary, the annotation of oligodendrocytes is not appropriate given the tissue type (prostate). A re-evaluation considering prostate-specific cell types and the possibility of mixed cell populations is recommended.'], ['Final Annotation Agent', '### Updated Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### 1.

Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type\nGiven the tissue context (prostate) and the expression of markers such as CDH19, HAND2, SCN7A, FOXD3, and PLP1, the most probable general cell type should be reconsidered.

Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis\nBased on the provided marker list and the tissue context (prostate), the most probable general cell type is epithelial cells.

The updated analysis correctly aligns these markers with cell types relevant to the prostate tissue context.\n\n2. **Biological Context**: The updated annotation appropriately considers the tissue type (prostate) and identifies cell types that are plausible within this context. Prostate epithelial cells, stromal cells, and immune cells (T-cells) are all relevant to the prostate tissue, making the annotation biologically appropriate.\n\n3. **Mixed Cell Type Consideration**: The analysis acknowledges the potential for mixed cell populations by identifying multiple probable sub cell types (prostate epithelial cells, stromal cells, and immune cells). This is a reasonable approach given the diversity of markers.\n\n### Confidence Assessment:\nThe confidence score of 8 reflects a high level of confidence in the updated annotation. The markers and tissue context are well-aligned, and the consideration of multiple cell types adds robustness to the analysis. However, the presence of some markers with limited functional information (e.g., TMEM155, HEPN1, FP325317.1) slightly reduces the confidence level.\n\nIn summary, the updated annotation is well-supported by the provided markers and the biological context of the prostate tissue. The identification of prostate epithelial cells as the most likely specific subtype is appropriate and consistent with the evidence.'], ['Formatting Agent', '{\n  ""main_cell_type"": ""Epithelial Cells"",\n  ""sub_cell_types"": [\n    ""Prostate Epithelial Cells"",\n    ""Stromal Cells"",\n    ""Immune Cells (T-cells)""\n  ],\n  ""num_markers"": 10,\n  ""confidence_score"": 8\n}']]"
