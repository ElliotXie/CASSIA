Consistency between the identified cell type and the provided markers:**\n\n- **CCL21, PROX1, FLT4**: These markers are indeed strongly associated with lymphatic endothelial cells, which supports the identification of the general cell type.\n- **TFF3**: This marker is associated with goblet cells, which are mucus-secreting cells found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. This marker does not align with the lymphatic endothelial cell type.\n- **MMRN1, PKHD1L1, TBX1, LRCOL1, GPR182, HOXD3**: These markers are not specifically indicative of lymphatic endothelial cells and may be expressed in various other cell types.\n\n**2. Alignment of the sub-cell types with the main cell type:**\n\n- The sub-cell types identified (lymphatic capillary endothelial cells, lymphatic collecting vessel endothelial cells, lymphatic valve endothelial cells) are appropriate subtypes within the lymphatic endothelial cell category.\n\n**3. Appropriateness of the annotation given the species and tissue type:**\n\n- The species is human, and the tissue type is lung. Lymphatic endothelial cells are present in the lung tissue, so the general cell type is appropriate. However, the presence of TFF3, a marker for goblet cells, suggests that there might be a mixed population or a different cell type present.\n\n**4. Consideration of the rank of the markers:**\n\n- The higher-ranked markers (CCL21, PROX1, FLT4) are consistent with lymphatic endothelial cells. However, the presence of TFF3, which is a high-ranking marker for goblet cells, raises concerns about the specificity of the annotation.\n\n**5. Proper consideration of the additional information provided during onboarding:**\n\n- The additional information provided does not indicate any specific context that would alter the interpretation of the markers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**VALIDATION FAILED**\n\n**Reason:**\n- The presence of TFF3, a marker for goblet cells, is inconsistent with the identification of the cell cluster as lymphatic endothelial cells. This suggests that the cell cluster may not be purely lymphatic endothelial cells or that there is a mixed population of cells. The annotation should be revisited to account for the presence of TFF3 and potentially identify a more accurate cell type or acknowledge the mixed cell population."

Involved in angiogenesis and the stabilization of blood vessels.\n\n### Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers\n1. **SCN7A**: Typically associated with neurons and muscle cells.\n2. **NKD2**: Broadly relevant to various cell types due to its role in Wnt signaling.\n3. **COL1A2, COL3A1**: Strong markers for fibroblasts and mesenchymal cells.\n4. **ADH1B**: Involved in alcohol metabolism, not specific to mesenchymal cells.\n5. **LAMA2**: Found in muscle cells and certain epithelial cells.\n6. **PDGFRA**: Strong marker for mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts.\n7. **ABCA6**: Involved in lipid transport, not specific to mesenchymal cells.\n8. **TCF21**: Marker for mesenchymal progenitor cells.\n9. **ANGPT1**: Found in endothelial cells and pericytes.\n\n### Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases\nUsing databases such as the Human Cell Atlas, PanglaoDB, and relevant literature, we can cross-reference these markers:\n\n- **SCN7A**: Found in neurons and muscle cells.\n- **NKD2**: Involved in Wnt signaling, broadly relevant.\n- **COL1A2, COL3A1, PDGFRA, TCF21**: Strongly associated with fibroblasts and mesenchymal cells.\n- **ADH1B**: Involved in alcohol metabolism, not specific to mesenchymal cells.\n- **LAMA2**: Found in muscle cells and certain epithelial cells.\n- **ABCA6**: Involved in lipid transport, not specific to mesenchymal cells.\n- **ANGPT1**: Found in endothelial cells and pericytes.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type\nGiven the feedback, we need to reconsider the general cell type. The presence of **SCN7A** and **LAMA2** suggests a different cell type than mesenchymal cells. These markers are more indicative of **muscle cells** or **epithelial cells**.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types\n1. **Smooth Muscle Cells**: Expression of SCN7A, LAMA2, PDGFRA, and COL1A2.\n2. **Epithelial Cells**: Expression of LAMA2, ADH1B, and NKD2.\n3. **Endothelial Cells**: Expression of ANGPT1 and PDGFRA.\n\nThe most likely subtype is **smooth muscle cells**, given the strong presence of SCN7A and LAMA2.\n\n### Step 6: Identify the Most Probable Sub-Sub Cell Type\nWithin smooth muscle cells, we can further narrow down to specific subtypes based on additional markers. However, the provided markers do not give enough resolution to distinguish between different smooth muscle cell subtypes. Therefore, the most specific cell type we can confidently identify is **smooth muscle cells**.\n\n### Step 7: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis\nBased on the provided marker list, the most probable general cell type is muscle cells. The top three most probable sub cell types are smooth muscle cells, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. The most likely subtype is smooth muscle cells. Due to the lack of more specific markers, the most specific cell type we can identify is smooth muscle cells.\n\n**FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED**"
