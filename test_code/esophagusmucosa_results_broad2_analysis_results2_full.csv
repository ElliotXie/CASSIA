However, the interpretation of these markers is problematic. For instance, while CCL21 and PROX1 are indicative of lymphatic endothelial cells, TFF3 is a marker for goblet cells, which are epithelial cells, and CD36 is a broad marker that can indicate macrophages, endothelial cells, or adipocytes. The presence of these markers suggests a mixed cell population rather than a single cell type.\n\n2. **Biological Context**: The esophagus mucosa is a complex tissue containing various cell types, including epithelial cells, immune cells, and endothelial cells.
