The heart is primarily composed of cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. The proposed annotation of \"neuronal cells\" and specifically \"synaptic neurons\" does not align well with the expected cell types in heart tissue. While neural crest cells can contribute to cardiac development, the specific markers provided (e.g., NRXN1, SLITRK2, SLITRK6) are more indicative of mature neurons rather than cells typically found in the heart.\n\n3. **Mixed Cell Type Consideration**: There is a possibility of mixed cell types, but the annotation does not address this adequately. The presence of markers like PLP1 (oligodendrocytes) and FOXD3 (neural crest cells) suggests a potential mix, but the dominant neuronal interpretation is not appropriate for heart tissue.\n\n### Suggested Alternatives or Areas for Re-evaluation:\n1. **Re-evaluate the markers in the context of heart tissue**: Consider markers that are more specific to cardiac cell types.
