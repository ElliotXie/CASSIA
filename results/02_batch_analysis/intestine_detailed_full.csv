Key functional markers and pathways -------------------------------------- I’ll group the top markers by functional “modules” to clarify the biology of this cluster. **A. Cytotoxic effector / granule machinery** - **Granzymes / perforin / cytotoxic machinery** - **GZMB, GZMH, GZMK, GZMM, GZMA** – classic cytotoxic effector serine proteases in CTL/NK compartments. - GZMB/GZMH → terminal effector cytotoxic T and NK cells. - GZMK often enriched in tissue-resident and/or “early effector” CD8 T cells. - **PRF1** – perforin, essential for granule-mediated cytotoxicity. - **CTSW** – cathepsin W, lysosomal protease highly enriched in cytotoxic T/NK cells. - **NKG7** – granule membrane protein, strongly associated with cytotoxic lymphocytes. - **CST7** – cystatin F, regulates cathepsins in cytotoxic granules; NK/CTL marker. These define a **highly cytotoxic lymphocyte** population. **B. NK receptor / innate-like activation module** - **KLR family (NK receptors):** - **KLRK1 (NKG2D)** – activating NK receptor; also expressed on highly activated CD8 T cells with NK-like features. - **KLRD1 (CD94)** – NK receptor dimerization partner (e.g., with KLRCs). - **KLRC2 (NKG2C), KLRC4 (NKG2E)** – activating NK receptors; enriched in NK cells and some NK-like CD8 T cells. - **CD160** – GPI-anchored receptor; on NK cells and a subset of cytotoxic CD8 T cells, often associated with effector function. - **CRTAM** – adhesion/activation marker expressed by activated CD8 T and NK cells, particularly in mucosal tissues. - **TNFRSF9 (4-1BB)** – costimulatory receptor induced on recently activated CD8 T cells. - **GPR18** – G protein–coupled receptor; enriched in tissue-resident and/or γδ and mucosal T cells (IEL-like). These point to an **innate-like, NK-receptor–rich cytotoxic T compartment**, not naive or central memory. **C. Chemokines / cytokine effector module** - **XCL1, XCL2** – chemokines produced almost exclusively by cytotoxic NK and CD8 T cells; key hallmark of XCL1⁺ effector CTLs that recruit XCR1⁺ cDC1. - **CCL4, CCL4L2, CCL5** – classic inflammatory chemokines produced by effector CD8 T/NK cells; drive recruitment of other immune cells. - **IFNG** – hallmark Th1 / Tc1 cytokine; key effector of cytotoxic T and NK responses. This is a **strong Tc1/Type 1 cytotoxic signature**. **D. Coinhibitory / activation / exhaustion-like signatures** - **TIGIT, LAG3, CD160** – canonical co-inhibitory receptors; co-expression is typical of **exhausted / chronically stimulated CD8 T cells**, including tumor- and inflammation-associated populations. - **LAYN** – strongly enriched in exhausted / dysfunctional human CD8 T cells (e.g., tumor-infiltrating and chronically stimulated tissue-resident CD8s). - **ENTPD1 (CD39)** – ectonucleotidase; classic marker of **chronically activated/exhausted, often tissue-resident CD8 T cells** in solid tissues. - **TNFRSF9 (4-1BB)** – activation-induced costimulatory receptor; frequently upregulated in recently activated/exhausted CD8 T cells. - **TMIGD2 (CD28H)** – costimulatory receptor on naive and early-activated T cells; can persist on some T subsets. Together, **TIGIT⁺ LAG3⁺ LAYN⁺ ENTPD1⁺** define a **chronically activated/exhausted cytotoxic T-cell phenotype** rather than a purely naive or transient effector. **E. T cell signaling and lineage regulators** - **CD8A, CD8B, CD7** – canonical **T-cell**, specifically CD8 T-cell markers. - **TRGC1, TRGC2** – TCR γ-chain genes, strongly associated with **γδ T cells** or γ-chain expression; presence suggests a γδ- or IEL-like component, though CD8B must also be considered (see below). - **SH2D1A (SAP)** – adaptor in SLAM signaling; T/NK cells, particularly cytotoxic CD8 T and NKT. - **PTPN22** – phosphatase associated with TCR signaling; T-cell predominant. - **IL21R** – IL-21 receptor; expressed in subsets of **activated/exhausted CD8 T cells** and some Tfh/Tph, but here in a cytotoxic background. - **PRKCH** – PKCη; enriched in certain T-cell lineages, including **γδ T cells and tissue-resident T** populations. - **HOPX, ZEB2, IKZF2 (Helios)** – transcriptional regulators: - **HOPX** – associated with **tissue-resident memory (Trm)** and long-lived effector CD8 T cells, particularly in mucosa. - **ZEB2** – drives **terminal effector/cytotoxic differentiation** of CD8 T cells (often co-expressed with T-bet). - **IKZF2 (Helios)** – T-cell transcription factor; seen in activated/exhausted CD8s and some regulatory subsets; can be enriched in tissue-resident/exhausted populations. These TFs support a **terminally differentiated cytotoxic CD8 T / Trm-like program** rather than NK or B cells. **F. Other immune / accessory genes** - **ATP8B4** – P4-ATPase, enriched in immune cells including microglia/myeloid and cytotoxic lymphocytes; not lineage-defining but immune-associated. - **ABI3, AOAH, LDLRAD4, DUSP4, CLIC3, APBA2, PARD6G** – various regulation of signaling, cytoskeleton, vesicle trafficking, polarity; not cell-type specific but compatible with highly activated lymphocytes. --- 2. Key cell-type markers pointing to tissue/cell identity -------------------------------------------------------- **A. T vs NK identity** - Strong **T-cell markers**: - **CD8A, CD8B, CD7, TRGC1, TRGC2, SH2D1A, PTPN22, IL21R** These clearly indicate a **T-lymphocyte** rather than purely innate ILC. - Absence (from top markers) of canonical **NK-only** markers: - No **NCAM1 (CD56)**, **FCGR3A (CD16)**, or **KLRF1**, which are typical in mature peripheral NK cells. - KLRD1/KLRK1/KLRC2/4 are present but these can be expressed strongly on **NK-like CD8 T cells and tissue-resident cytotoxic T cells** in mucosa. So this is best classified as **CD8 T cells with NK-like features** rather than classical NK cells. **B. CD8 cytotoxic T vs helper or regulatory T** - **CD8A, CD8B, GZMB, PRF1, NKG7, CTSW, CST7, XCL1/2, IFNG, CCL4/5** This is the canonical **CD8⁺ cytotoxic Tc1 phenotype**. - No strong **CD4 T helper/regulatory** signature (e.g., low/absent FOXP3, IL2RA, CCR7, CXCR5, BCL6, RORA/RORC, etc., in this marker panel). Thus, these are **CD8⁺ cytotoxic T lymphocytes**. **C. γδ T / IEL-like features** - **TRGC1, TRGC2, PRKCH, GPR18**: - TRGC1/2: hallmark of **TCRγ chain**, strongly pointing to a **γδ T** transcriptomic component or cells that at least use γ-chain transcripts. - GPR18: enriched in **γδ T cells and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs)**. - PRKCH: reported enrichment in γδ and tissue-resident T cells. - However: - **CD8B** is high; canonical intestinal **γδ IEL** often are CD8αα or CD8-negative rather than CD8αβ (i.e., CD8B low/absent). - So this could reflect either: - A mixed TCR usage (αβ CD8 T cells with residual TRGC expression), or - A **γδ T–enriched subset that still expresses CD8B** (less typical in humans, but not impossible in lamina propria/epithelial compartments). Given colon origin, these markers are consistent with **intestinal IEL-like cytotoxic T cells**, including some γδ-enriched transcriptional program. **D. Tissue-resident / exhausted tissue T cell features** - **ENTPD1 (CD39), LAYN, TIGIT, LAG3, HOPX, ZEB2, IKZF2**: - CD39⁺ TIGIT⁺ LAG3⁺ LAYN⁺ CD8 T cells are characteristic of **chronically activated, tissue-resident / exhausted CD8 T cells in non-lymphoid tissues**, including human colon and tumors. - HOPX and ZEB2 are compatible with **Trm-like and terminal effector** differentiation in barrier tissues (skin, gut). - **CRTAM, GPR18** further support **mucosal localization** (intestinal, epithelial-associated CD8 T). Thus, within colon, this is best matched to **mucosal tissue-resident or IEL-like cytotoxic CD8 T cells with exhaustion/chronic activation features**. --- 3. Cross-referencing with scRNA-seq databases and literature ----------------------------------------------------------- Using known atlases and databases for large intestine: - **Smillie et al., Cell 2019 (human colon, UC)**: - Defined multiple CD8 T clusters: CD8_Tem, CD8_Trm, CD8_Tex, IELs, etc. - IEL / Trm / Tex CD8 populations exhibit: - High **GZMB, NKG7, PRF1, CTSW, CCL4/5**, **KLRD1/KLRK1**, **XCL1**, **IFNG**. - Exhaustion markers **LAG3, TIGIT, ENTPD1 (CD39)** in Tex/Trm compartments. - Their IEL cluster also showed **γδ markers (TRGC1/2)** and tissue-residency transcription factors (HOPX, ZEB2). - This marker pattern fits almost exactly with the presented list. - **PanglaoDB / CellMarker / Human Protein Atlas (single cell)**: - “CD8 cytotoxic T cell” signatures include **CD8A/B, NKG7, PRF1, GZMB, CTSW, CCL4/5**, XCL1 (for effector CTLs). - “NK T cell / NK-like T” signatures: **KLRD1, KLRK1, KLRC2, KLRC4**, GZMB, NKG7 plus T markers. - “γδ T cell” entries: **TRGC1, TRGC2, TRDC, PRKCH, GPR18**, alongside cytotoxic effector genes. - “Exhausted CD8 T” or tumor-infiltrating CD8 Tex: **LAYN, ENTPD1, TIGIT, LAG3**, co-expressed with granzyme/perforin genes. - **Colorectal/intestinal scRNA studies (e.g., Zhang et al., Immunity 2018; Guo et al., Nat Med 2018; Zhang et al., Cell 2020):** - CD39⁺ TIGIT⁺ LAG3⁺ **exhausted/Trm CD8 T** subsets in colon tissue and colorectal tumors have: - High **GZMB, PRF1, NKG7, CCL4/5**, **XCL1/2**. - Co-expression of **KLRD1/KLRK1**, sometimes | Final Annotation Agent: 4. Most probable **general** cell type -------------------------------------- Putting the functional and lineage markers together: - Strong **T-cell lineage**: CD8A, CD8B, CD7, PTPN22, SH2D1A, IL21R - Strong **cytotoxic effector program**: GZMB/H/K/M, GZMA, PRF1, NKG7, CTSW, CST7 - **NK-receptor rich but T-lineage**: KLRK1, KLRD1, KLRC2, KLRC4, CD160, CRTAM - **Tc1 cytokine/chemokine program**: IFNG, XCL1/2, CCL4/4L2, CCL5 - **Chronic activation / exhaustion / Trm markers**: ENTPD1, TIGIT, LAG3, LAYN, HOPX, ZEB2, IKZF2 - **Intestinal/IEL-like module**: TRGC1, TRGC2, GPR18, PRKCH This profile is most consistent with **T cells**, specifically **CD8⁺ cytotoxic T lymphocytes**, rather than NK cells or other ILCs. **General cell type:** **CD8⁺ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (Tc1), intestinal, highly activated / tissue-resident / exhausted.** --- 5. Top 3 most probable **sub cell types** (ranked) -------------------------------------------------- ### 1) Intestinal tissue-resident / exhausted cytotoxic CD8 T cell (most likely) **Rationale:** - **Tissue-residency / chronic stimulation markers:** - **ENTPD1 (CD39)** – canonical for tissue-resident, chronically stimulated CD8 T in barrier tissues and tumors. - **LAYN, TIGIT, LAG3** – classical human CD8 Tex/Trm markers (seen in Smillie 2019 colon CD8_Trm/Tex; multiple CRC datasets). - **HOPX, ZEB2, IKZF2** – Trm/terminal effector TF program. - **Effector Tc1 program:** - **GZMB/H/M, PRF1, NKG7, CTSW, CST7**, **XCL1/2**, **IFNG**, **CCL4/5** – canonical for **Trm/Tex CD8 T** in colon (Smillie 2019 “CD8_TRM_LAYN/CD8_Tex”, CRC datasets). - **Mucosal localization markers:** - **CRTAM, GPR18** – enriched in mucosal/epithelial CD8 T and IEL-like T cells. - **NK-like receptor pattern but clearly T-lineage:** - NK receptors (KLRK1, KLRD1, KLRC2/4, CD160) often appear in **tissue-resident or tumor-infiltrating CD8 T** in mucosa; absence of CD56/FCGR3A supports “NK-like CD8 T” rather than NK. This aligns very well with the **CD39⁺, LAYN⁺, TIGIT⁺, LAG3⁺ CD8 Trm/Tex populations** described in human colon and colorectal tumor scRNA-seq atlases. **Best short label:** **“CD8⁺ Trm/Tex cytotoxic T cell (intestinal, XCL1⁺ NK-like)”** ### 2) Intestinal NK-like CD8 T cell (non-classical, innate-like cytotoxic CD8) **Rationale:** - Strong expression of **NK-receptors**: - KLRK1, KLRD1, KLRC2, KLRC4, CD160 – typical of NK and **NK-like CD8 T**. - Robust **granule and chemokine program** is compatible with both NK and CD8 T. - Clear **T-lineage markers (CD8A/B, CD7, TRGC1/2, PTPN22, SH2D1A)** without canonical NK-only markers (NCAM1/CD56, FCGR3A/CD16, KLRF1). This matches the “NK-like CD8 T” or “CD8_IEL_NK-like” clusters often found in gut atlases: cytotoxic CD8 T with broad NK-receptor usage, sometimes described as **CD8⁺ ILC1-like**. **Short label:** **“NK-receptor–rich NK-like CD8⁺ cytotoxic T cell (intestinal)”** ### 3) Intestinal γδ-like cytotoxic T / IEL-like T cell **Rationale:** - **γδ/IEL-associated markers:** - **TRGC1, TRGC2** – strong hallmarks of TCRγ usage. - **GPR18, PRKCH** – enriched in γδ T and IEL programs. - Intestinal context favors **IEL-like T** populations, which include both αβ and γδ T cells with a highly cytotoxic program. However: - **CD8B is strongly expressed**, which is more typical of CD8αβ αβ T cells, whereas classical human γδ IELs are often CD8αα or CD8⁻. - The gene list does not include clear TRDC/TRDV/TRGV reads (though they may exist outside this ranked list). Therefore, γδ/IEL-like identity is **plausible but less strongly supported** than Trm/Tex CD8 identity. It is likely that some cells in this cluster are γδ or share a **γδ-enriched/IEL program**, but the dominant annotation remains αβ CD8 Trm/Tex. **Short label:** **“Intestinal IEL-like T cell with γδ-associated transcriptional features”** --- 6. Concise summary and final annotation --------------------------------------- - The cluster is **T-lineage, not NK**, based on CD8A/B, CD7, TRGC1/2, PTPN22, SH2D1A, IL21R and lack of classical NK-only markers. - It shows a **strong cytotoxic Tc1 profile** (GZMB/H/M, PRF1, NKG7, CTSW, CCL4/5, XCL1/2, IFNG). - Co-expression of **ENTPD1 (CD39), LAYN, TIGIT, LAG3, HOPX, ZEB2, IKZF2** indicates **tissue-resident / exhausted CD8 T cells** in a chronically stimulated environment (mucosa/tumor). - NK receptors (KLRK1, KLRD1, KLRC2/4, CD160, CRTAM) indicate an **NK-like effector phenotype**, common in mucosal Trm/Tex CD8 subsets. - Intestinal / IEL-like markers (TRGC1/2, GPR18, PRKCH) support localization to **intestinal epithelium or lamina propria** with an IEL-like program. **Final ranked annotation:** 1. **Most likely:** **Intestinal CD8⁺ tissue-resident / exhausted cytotoxic T cell (Trm/Tex, XCL1⁺, CD39⁺, NK-receptor–rich)** 2. **Second:** **Intestinal NK-like CD8⁺ cytotoxic T cell (innate-like CD8, KLRK1⁺KLRD1⁺)** 3. **Third:** **Intestinal IEL-like T cell with γδ-associated features (TRGC1/2⁺, GPR18⁺)** **Preferred final label for this cluster:** **CD8⁺ Trm/Tex cytotoxic T cell (intestinal, NK-like / XCL1⁺)** FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED | Coupling Validator: Validation result: VALIDATION PASSED | Formatting Agent: ```json { ""main_cell_type"": ""CD8⁺ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (Tc1), intestinal, highly activated / tissue-resident / exhausted"", ""sub_cell_types"": [ ""CD8⁺ Trm/Tex cytotoxic T cell (intestinal, XCL1⁺ NK-like)"", ""NK-receptor–rich NK-like CD8⁺ cytotoxic T cell (intestinal)"", ""Intestinal IEL-like T cell with γδ-associated transcriptional features"" ], ""possible_mixed_cell_types"": [ ""Mixed TCR usage in αβ CD8 T cells with residual TRGC expression"", ""γδ T–enriched intestinal IEL-like CD8 T-cell subset that expresses CD8B"" ] } ```"

Key functional / pathway markers in the list and their roles --------------------------------------------------------------- Focusing on the *coding* / non-pseudogene entries that are biologically informative: - **LGR5 (Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5)** - Canonical Wnt target gene and receptor for R-spondins. - Master marker of **intestinal stem cells (ISCs)** in crypt base columnar (CBC) cells. - Highly enriched at the crypt base of small intestine and colon; defines long-term, self-renewing stem cells. - **ASCL2 (Achaete-Scute Family BHLH Transcription Factor 2)** - Wnt-responsive transcription factor; crucial for maintenance of **LGR5+ intestinal stem cells**. - Directly regulates a stem cell gene program; loss leads to depletion of CBC stem cells. - Strongly co-expressed with LGR5 in ISC population. - **TDGF1 (Teratocarcinoma-Derived Growth Factor 1 / Cripto)** - GPI-anchored EGF-CFC family protein; co-receptor for NODAL and related TGF-β ligands. - Enriched in **embryonic / fetal-like or stem/progenitor** states in multiple epithelia. - In gut, associated with high Wnt and progenitor/ISC-like programs; often upregulated in regenerative or more primitive epithelial states. - **IGFBPL1 (Insulin Like Growth Factor Binding Protein Like 1)** - IGFBP-like protein modulating IGF signaling and growth/survival. - Not gut-specific, but expression is often enriched in progenitor / stem-like contexts in various tissues. - **SLC39A2 (ZIP2, Solute Carrier Family 39 Member 2)** - Zinc importer; zinc is important for proliferating cells and for transcription factor function. - Typically higher in metabolically active, proliferative, or stem/progenitor compartments rather than terminally differentiated colonocytes. The remainder of the list is dominated by: - **Histone and chromatin-associated pseudogenes**: - HMGN2P6, HMGN2P9, HMGN2P4, HMGN2P41, HMGN2P3, HMGN1P36, HMGN1P38 - **Ribosomal and translation-related pseudogenes**: - RPL7P54, RPL41P1, RPL41P5, RPL9P21, RPL21P16, RPL7P6, RPS26P39, RPSAP8, RPSAP15 - **PPIA and metabolic enzyme pseudogenes**: - PPIAP40, PPIAP11, PPIAP29, PPIAP31, TPI1P1, COX5AP2, SDHDP6, ATP5PFP1, EIF5AP4, EEF1A1P5 - **Other non-coding / lncRNA-like / uncharacterized loci**: - AL031284.1, AC012085.1, AC010132.3, AC008694.2, AC092670.1, AC090498.1, AL162151.2, AC016596.2, AL603825.1, AC005884.2, AL035411.1, AF279873.1, AC112491.1, AC022968.1, FABP5P7, KRT8P13, etc. These mostly reflect high global transcriptional/translation activity and technical mapping to pseudogenes, and do not strongly constrain cell identity beyond indicating a metabolically active/proliferative state. Functionally, the **Wnt-driven stemness program** (LGR5, ASCL2, TDGF1) is the dominant informative signal in this marker set. 2. Key cell-type markers and their implications ----------------------------------------------- ### Intestinal epithelial stem/progenitor markers - **LGR5** - Gold-standard marker of **intestinal crypt base columnar (CBC) stem cells** in both small intestine and colon. - Specifically marks long-lived stem cells at crypt base, not Paneth, goblet, enteroendocrine, or mature colonocytes. - **ASCL2** - ISC-specific transcription factor, essential for maintenance of the LGR5+ pool. - Highly enriched in CBCs in human and mouse colon; co-localizes with LGR5. - **TDGF1** - Not a classic “textbook” ISC marker, but in intestinal and colonic epithelium it is: - Upregulated in stem/progenitor / fetal-like programs. - Enriched in high-Wnt/high-plasticity contexts (development, regeneration, and sometimes cancer stem-like compartments). - Its presence alongside LGR5/ASCL2 supports a **primitive stem/progenitor identity** rather than a differentiated lineage. - **Absence of canonical lineage markers** - No markers for: - Goblet cells: e.g., MUC2, TFF3. - Enteroendocrine cells: e.g., CHGA, CHGB, NEUROD1, PAX6. - Tuft cells: e.g., DCLK1, TRPM5, POU2F3. - Colonocytes / absorptive enterocytes: e.g., KRT20, CA1/2, ALPI, SLC26A3, EPCAM-high with KRT20, etc. - Paneth-like/secretory (more prominent in small intestine but some colonic crypt base secretory): LYZ, defensins. - Strong lack of differentiated-lineage markers suggests a **stem or very early progenitor** cluster. ### General epithelial context - Presence of (pseudo)keratin KRT8P13, FABP5P7 (FABP5-like), many ribosomal/translation genes: - Compatible with an **epithelial**, metabolically active cell population. - But these are not specific enough to distinguish epithelial subtypes; the specificity comes from LGR5/ASCL2. Collectively, the strongest identity-defining markers in this list are **LGR5 and ASCL2**, which are *definitive* for **intestinal epithelial stem cells** in crypts of the large intestine. 3. Cross-referencing with scRNA-seq databases and literature ------------------------------------------------------------ Using knowledge from common resources and literature (rather than live queries): - **PanglaoDB / CellMarker / Human Cell Atlas (HCA) / Tabula Sapiens / gut atlases (e.g., Martin et al., Smillie et al., Elmentaite et al.)** - Intestinal stem cell clusters from human colon consistently show: - **LGR5**, **ASCL2**, **SMOC2**, **MEX3A**, **OLFM4**, **SOX9**, high Wnt target gene expression. - LGR5 and ASCL2 are heavily used to annotate **“intestinal stem cell / crypt base columnar (CBC) cells”**. - TDGF1 expression has been reported in: - Fetal intestinal epithelial progenitors. - Regenerative/fetal-like stem-like populations in IBD and injury. - High-Wnt stem/progenitor states, including some colon cancer stem-like cells. - **Literature** - Barker et al., Nature 2007; Barker, van Es et al. – define **LGR5+ CBC cells as the intestinal stem cell** population. - van der Flier et al., *Cell* 2009; Schuijers et al. – describe **ASCL2** as a Wnt-driven TF essential for intestinal stem cell maintenance and co-expressed with LGR5 in CBCs. - Recent human colonic scRNA-seq atlases (Smillie et al., *Cell* 2019; Elmentaite et al., Nature 2021) identify **LGR5+/ASCL2+ clusters** as “crypt base columnar / intestinal stem cells”. These datasets and papers uniformly support the interpretation that a cluster marked strongly by **LGR5 and ASCL2**, in large intestine epithelium, corresponds to **intestinal stem cells at the crypt base** rather than transit-amplifying or differentiated cells. 4. Most probable general cell type ---------------------------------- Based on: - Strong expression of **LGR5** and **ASCL2** (canonical Wnt-high ISC markers). - Presence of **TDGF1** supporting a primitive, stem/progenitor program. - Absence of canonical differentiated epithelial lineage markers. - Context specified as **human large intestine (colonic) tissue**. **Most probable general cell type:** > **Intestinal epithelial stem cells (crypt base columnar cells) of the large intestine.** 5. Top 3 most probable sub cell types (ranked) and final subtype call --------------------------------------------------------------------- Within the broad category of **intestinal epithelial stem/progenitor compartment**, plausible subtypes include: 1. **LGR5+ crypt base columnar (CBC) stem cells (adult ISC) – Most likely** - Defining features: - High **LGR5** and **ASCL2** co-expression. - Wnt target gene program characteristic of crypt base. - The marker set provided exactly matches this signature: - No evidence of early differentiation toward any secretory or absorptive lineage. - No strong alternative lineage-defining markers present. - This is the canonical “intestinal stem cell” population in human colon. 2. **Early transit-amplifying (TA) progenitors with residual ISC signature – Second most likely** - TA cells just above the crypt base often: - Show reduced but still detectable **LGR5** / **ASCL2** expression. - Are highly proliferative and transcriptionally active (fits the pseudogene/ribosomal-rich pattern). - Counterpoint: - In many datasets, strong LGR5/ASCL2 is more tightly restricted to CBCs, with TA cells showing lower, more diffuse Wnt target expression and acquisition of early differentiation markers (which are not seen here). - So this is plausible but less well supported than pure CBC stem cells. 3. **Regenerative/fetal-like ISC-like population (e.g., TDGF1-high stem/progenitor) – Third most likely** - TDGF1 is associated with: - Fetal intestinal epithelium. - Regeneration/injury and “fetal-like” stem states. - In some colonic scRNA-seq studies, there are **revival/fetal-like stem cell clusters** distinct from canonical LGR5+ CBCs (often also expressing TACSTD2, LY6-family markers, etc.). - In this list: - TDGF1 supports a primitive state, but we **lack other canonical fetal-like markers**. - Thus a regenerative/fetal-like ISC subtype is conceivable but **less likely** than canonical CBC stem cells. ### Final subtype annotation Given the dominance and specificity of LGR5 and ASCL2 and the absence of alternative lineage signatures, the most parsimonious and well-supported annotation is: > **Most likely subtype: LGR5⁺/ASCL2⁺ crypt base columnar intestinal stem cells (adult colonic ISCs).** 6. Concise summary ------------------ - The only clearly informative, non-pseudogene markers are **LGR5**, **ASCL2**, and **TDGF1**, supported by a background of high ribosomal/translation-related pseudogenes indicating a highly active, proliferative state. - **LGR5** and **ASCL2** are canonical markers of **intestinal crypt base columnar stem cells** in the colon; databases and atlases consistently label LGR5+/ASCL2+ clusters as ISCs. - Lack of any goblet, enteroendocrine, tuft, Paneth-like, or mature colonocyte markers further supports a stem rather than differentiated identity. - TDGF1 is consistent with a primitive Wnt-high stem/progenitor signature, potentially with some fetal-like or regenerative bias, but not sufficient to override the canonical CBC assignment. **Final annotation:** - **General cell type:** Intestinal epithelial stem cell. - **Specific subtype:** **LGR5⁺/ASCL2⁺ crypt base columnar (CBC) stem cell of the human large intestine.** FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED | Coupling Validator: Validation result: VALIDATION PASSED | Formatting Agent: ```json { ""main_cell_type"": ""Intestinal epithelial stem cells (crypt base columnar cells) of the large intestine"", ""sub_cell_types"": [ ""LGR5+ crypt base columnar (CBC) stem cells (adult ISC)"", ""Early transit-amplifying (TA) progenitors with residual ISC signature"", ""Regenerative/fetal-like ISC-like population (e.g., TDGF1-high stem/progenitor)"" ], ""possible_mixed_cell_types"": [] } ```"

Prohormone processing and vesicular transport** - **PCSK1 (Prohormone convertase 1/3)** - Key enzyme that cleaves prohormones such as **proglucagon** into active GLP-1, GLP-2, etc. - High in **L cells and other mature enteroendocrine cells**; also in pancreatic β-cells. - **SLC18A1 (VMAT1)** - Vesicular monoamine transporter 1; loads monoamines into secretory vesicles. - Expressed in **enteroendocrine / neuroendocrine** cells and some EC cells. - **SLC32A1 (VGAT)** - Vesicular GABA transporter; canonical neuronal/neuroendocrine vesicle transporter. - Supports neurosecretory phenotype. - **RIMBP2, CPLX2, SNAP25, CDK5R2** - **Synaptic vesicle release machinery** (presynaptic active zone scaffold, complexin, SNARE protein, and CDK5 regulatory subunit). - Strongly characteristic of **neuroendocrine cells** with synapse-like secretory machinery (typical of EECs, pancreatic islet cells, sympathetic neurons). - **ABCC8 (SUR1)** - Regulatory subunit of the ATP-sensitive K⁺ channel (KATP), classically expressed in **pancreatic β-cells** and some L cells. - Supports a regulated, glucose-sensitive excitability typical of hormone-secreting cells. - **KCNB2** - Voltage-gated K⁺ channel, contributes to membrane excitability. **c. Monoamine / serotonin-related metabolism** - **TPH1 (Tryptophan hydroxylase 1)** - Rate-limiting enzyme for **serotonin synthesis** in peripheral tissues. - Canonical marker of **enterochromaffin (EC) enteroendocrine cells**, but can be expressed at variable levels in some other EEC subtypes, particularly in colon where hybrid phenotypes (L/EC) are known. **d. Signaling receptors and modulators** - **AVPR1B (Vasopressin receptor 1B)** - G-protein-coupled receptor; strongly expressed in pituitary corticotrophs and some **neuroendocrine** lineages. - Its presence again supports a **neuroendocrine endocrine** identity. - **RGS4** - Regulator of G-protein signaling; widely used in neuronal/neuroendocrine cells to modulate GPCR signaling. **e. Structural / intermediate filament / axonal markers** - **PRPH (Peripherin), INA (Alpha-internexin)** - Neuronal intermediate filament proteins. - Often expressed in **neuroendocrine-like** intestinal cells (enteroendocrine cells share partial neuronal gene programs). - **RTN1, CRMP1** - Associated with neuronal morphology and neurite outgrowth, again reflecting a neuroendocrine/neuronal-like transcriptional program. **f. Transporters / metabolic and miscellaneous** - **SLC5A8** - Sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter. Expressed in intestinal epithelium; can be present in various epithelial subsets including EECs. - **F5, COL2A1, LCN15, CELF3** - These are less directly informative for canonical gut epithelial subtype here; might reflect low-level background or partial/off-target expression, but they do not override the very strong enteroendocrine signature. --- 2. **Key Cell-Type Defining Markers (Lineage / Identity)** **a. Enteroendocrine / neuroendocrine lineage transcription factors** - **RFX6** - Critical transcription factor for **intestinal enteroendocrine cell differentiation**. - Mutations cause congenital enteroendocrine deficiency syndromes. Strong, canonical EEC marker. - **NKX2-2** - Homeobox TF important in **endocrine cell differentiation** in pancreas and intestine. - Expressed in multiple neuroendocrine lineages including EECs. - **INSM1** - Pan-neuroendocrine transcription factor, essential for **neuroendocrine differentiation** (islets, EECs, pituitary). - Highly enriched in EECs. - **FEV (PET1)** - ETS-family TF, associated with serotonergic/neuroendocrine lineages, including subsets of **enteroendocrine cells**. - **ARX** - Homeobox TF; involved in specification of several endocrine lineages (pancreatic α-cells, some gut EECs). - Seen in subsets of **proglucagon / PYY expressing intestinal endocrine cells**. Collectively, RFX6 + NKX2-2 + INSM1 + FEV + ARX is a very strong signature of **intestinal enteroendocrine cells**, not generic epithelium. **b. General neuroendocrine secretory identity** A large set of genes define the classic neuroendocrine phenotype: - Granins: **CHGA, CHGB, SCG2, SCG3, SCG5** - Vesicular transport: **SLC18A1, SLC32A1** - Exocytotic machinery: **SNAP25, CPLX2, RIMBP2** - Neuronal-like cytoskeleton: **PRPH, INA** - Transcriptional/neural regulators: **FEV, CRMP1, CDK5R2, RTN1, RGS4** This pattern is textbook **neuroendocrine / enteroendocrine**, and entirely inconsistent with absorptive enterocytes, goblet cells, tuft cells, or stromal/immune lineages. **c. Enteroendocrine subtype–defining hormone pattern** Among EECs, the combination of: - **GCG (proglucagon)** - **PYY** - **INSL5** - Plus neuroendocrine granule and TF markers is **highly characteristic of colonic L cells**, rather than other enteroendocrine subtypes: - EC cells: TPH1-high, TAC1/CHGA/TPH1/SLC6A4, but **usually lack strong GCG and INSL5**. - K cells: GIP, not present here. - I cells: CCK, not present here. - D cells: SST, not present. - N cells / other rare types: would express characteristic hormones (e.g., neurotensin) that are absent here. The presence of TPH1 does suggest **some serotonergic capacity**, which is consistent with described **L/EC hybrid subtypes** in colon, but the core hormone panel is L-cell–type. --- 3. **Cross-reference with known scRNA-seq resources / literature** Based on standard scRNA-seq atlases and EEC studies: - **Haber et al., Cell 2017 (mouse small intestine EEC atlas)** - L cell cluster: **Gcg+Pyy+Insl5**, with strong neuroendocrine granule genes and Rfx6, Insm1. Very similar transcriptional profile, minus some species/tissue differences. - **Elmentaite et al., Nature 2021 – Human Gut Cell Atlas (colon)** - Distal colonic **L cells**: co-expression of **GCG, PYY, INSL5** plus chromogranins and RFX6/INSM1. - INSL5 in particular is highlighted as a **marker of distal colon L cells**. - **Other human scRNA-seq gut atlases (e.g., Smillie et al., 2019; Tabula Sapiens intestinal datasets)** - “L cell” clusters show **GCG+PYY** and often **INSL5**, with neuroendocrine granule and TF markers very similar to those present here (RFX6, NKX2-2, INSM1, CHGA/B, SCG2/3/5, SLC18A1). - **Human Protein Atlas / neuroendocrine tumor profiling** - Co-expression of **CHGA, CHGB, SCG2, INSM1, PCSK1** identifies neuroendocrine lineage; in gut, those map to enteroendocrine cells. The **exact combination GCG + PYY + INSL5 + RFX6 + INSM1 + CHGA/B** in human colon datasets is consistently annotated as **“L cell” / “colon L cell”**. --- 4. **Most Probable General Cell Type** Given: - Robust expression of **enteroendocrine TFs** (RFX6, NKX2-2, INSM1, FEV, ARX), - Strong **neuroendocrine granule and vesicle machinery** (CHGA/B, SCG2/3/5, SNAP25, SLC18A1, SLC32A1, CPLX2, RIMBP2), - Presence of multiple **gut peptide hormones** (GCG, PYY, INSL5, UCN3, SCT), - Tissue context: **human large intestine (colon)**, the **general cell type** is: > **Intestinal enteroendocrine cell (neuroendocrine epithelial cell)**. --- 5. **Top 3 Most Probable Subtypes (within enteroendocrine cells)** **Rank 1 – Most likely: Colonic L cell (GLP‑1/GLP‑2/PYY/INSL5-secreting enteroendocrine cell)** Justification: - **GCG**: hallmark of L cells in intestine (proglucagon-derived peptides, GLP‑1/2). - **PYY**: classical co-hormone of L cells, especially in ileum and colon. - **INSL5**: highly specific to **distal colonic L cells**; its co-expression with GCG+PYY is a recognized L-cell fingerprint. - **PCSK1**: appropriate prohormone convertase for GLP-1/2 production from proglucagon in L cells. - **RFX6, NKX2-2, INSM1, ARX, FEV**: consistent with a mature EEC L-cell transcriptional program. - **Colonic context**: dataset is from **large intestine**; INSL5+GCG+PYY in colon is the canonical **L cell** phenotype reported in human colon scRNA-seq atlases. This combination is too specific to reasonably be anything other than **L cells** in the colon. --- **Rank 2 – L/EC hybrid colonic enteroendocrine cell (L-like cell with serotonergic features)** Justification: - **TPH1** is typically a defining enzyme of **enterochromaffin (EC) cells**, the main serotonin producers in the gut. - However, in recent high-resolution scRNA-seq studies of the colon, **EEC subtypes with mixed hormone and TPH1 expression** are described (e.g., GCG+PYY+TPH1+ cells), sometimes annotated as L/EC hybrids. - Presence of **TPH1** along with a strong L-cell signature (GCG+PYY+INSL5) suggests this cluster might not be purely classical L cells but could include **L cells with partial serotonergic machinery**, particularly in the distal colon where plasticity between EEC subtypes has been documented. Thus, a plausible second interpretation is: > **Hybrid L/EC enteroendocrine cell subtype**, still fundamentally within the L-cell-like branch. --- ** | Final Annotation Agent: 5. **Top 3 Most Probable Subtypes (within enteroendocrine cells)** You already have: - **Rank 1 – Colonic L cell (GLP‑1/GLP‑2/PYY/INSL5-secreting enteroendocrine cell)** - **Rank 2 – L/EC hybrid colonic enteroendocrine cell (L-like cell with serotonergic features)** I’ll add a third plausible but less likely subtype and then state the final choice. --- **Rank 3 – Generic proglucagon-lineage enteroendocrine cell (GCG⁺PYY⁺ EEC without strict INSL5-based subclassification)** Rationale: - A subset of human intestinal EECs in scRNA-seq atlases can be broadly defined as **GCG⁺PYY⁺ proglucagon-lineage cells**, sometimes annotated simply as **“GCG⁺ EEC”** or **“proglucagon EEC”**, without explicit subdivision into L vs hybrid states. - The presence of: - **GCG + PYY** (canonical L/proglucagon-lineage hormones), - strong **neuroendocrine machinery** (CHGA/B, SCG2/3/5, SNAP25, SLC18A1, SLC32A1, CPLX2, RIMBP2), - and **EEC TFs** (RFX6, NKX2-2, INSM1, ARX, FEV), unequivocally places these cells in the **proglucagon⁺ enteroendocrine lineage**, even if one chose not to resolve finer L vs L/EC subtypes. - This would be the label you might use if: - clustering resolution is low, or - you prefer **collapsing L and L/EC into a single “GCG⁺PYY⁺ EEC” class** to maintain cross-dataset comparability. It is less specific than calling them “L cells” and does not exploit the strong INSL5 signal, hence ranked third. --- **Most likely subtype (final choice)** Given the **very strong, hallmark combination**: - **GCG + PYY + INSL5** - Classic **neuroendocrine/EEC TFs**: RFX6, INSM1, NKX2-2, ARX, FEV - Neuroendocrine secretion machinery: CHGA/B, SCG2/3/5, SLC18A1, SNAP25, CPLX2, RIMBP2 - Colonic context (large intestine) the **most specific and well-supported annotation** is: > **Colonic L cell (GCG⁺/PYY⁺/INSL5⁺ enteroendocrine cell)** You can optionally note in your metadata that this cluster exhibits **some serotonergic machinery (TPH1)** consistent with **L/EC-like features**, but functionally and transcriptionally it is best classified as a **distal colonic L cell**. --- 6. **Concise Summary of Analysis** - The marker set is dominated by: - **Enteroendocrine hormones**: GCG, PYY, INSL5, UCN3, SCT - **Neuroendocrine granule and vesicle genes**: CHGA/B, SCG2/3/5, SNAP25, CPLX2, SLC18A1, SLC32A1, RIMBP2 - **EEC lineage TFs**: RFX6, NKX2-2, INSM1, FEV, ARX - **Serotonin enzyme**: TPH1 - This unambiguously defines a **neuroendocrine enteroendocrine epithelial cell** from the gut. - The specific combination **GCG + PYY + INSL5** in **colon** is the signature of **distal colonic L cells**, as shown in multiple human gut scRNA-seq atlases (e.g., Elmentaite et al., Smillie et al.). - TPH1 expression suggests a degree of **L/EC hybridization**, but does not override the L-cell-defining hormone pattern. **Final annotation for this cluster: → “Enteroendocrine L cells (colonic GCG⁺/PYY⁺/INSL5⁺ L cells; L/EC-hybrid-like)”** FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED | Coupling Validator: Validation result: VALIDATION PASSED | Formatting Agent: ```json { ""main_cell_type"": ""Intestinal enteroendocrine cell (neuroendocrine epithelial cell)"", ""sub_cell_types"": [ ""Colonic L cell (GLP‑1/GLP‑2/PYY/INSL5-secreting enteroendocrine cell)"", ""L/EC hybrid colonic enteroendocrine cell (L-like cell with serotonergic features)"", ""Generic proglucagon-lineage enteroendocrine cell (GCG⁺PYY⁺ EEC without strict INSL5-based subclassification)"" ], ""possible_mixed_cell_types"": [ ""L/EC hybrid colonic enteroendocrine cell (L-like cell with serotonergic features)"", ""Enteroendocrine L cells (colonic GCG⁺/PYY⁺/INSL5⁺ L cells; L/EC-hybrid-like)"" ] } ```"

Key functional marker groups (with roles) I’ll first organize the markers into functional/pathway groups to see what biology dominates. **A. Glial / myelin / ionic homeostasis–related genes** These strongly point to a glial, Schwann/oligodendrocyte-like lineage. - **PLP1** – Proteolipid protein 1, major myelin component in CNS oligodendrocytes, also expressed in **Schwann cells and enteric glia**. Canonical marker of myelinating glia lineages. - **CDH19** – A cadherin highly enriched in **peripheral myelinating Schwann cells** and **oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs)** in CNS scRNA-seq atlases (e.g. Tasic et al., Hodge et al.). - **CMTM5** – Strongly expressed in **oligodendrocytes / myelinating glia**, often used as a glial myelin/OPC marker. - **ATP1A2** – Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase α2 subunit; classical **astrocyte / glial** isoform in CNS and peripheral glia, maintaining K⁺ homeostasis around neurons. - **NKAIN3** – Interacts with Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase; enriched in **neuronal and glial** populations, especially in myelinated tracts. - **PTPRZ1** – Receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase ζ; high in **OPCs, astrocytes and glial progenitors**; central node in glial cell regulation. - **GJC3** – Gap junction protein (connexin family); gap junctions are important for **glial–glial coupling**. - **CHST9** – Carbohydrate sulfotransferase; involved in modification of proteoglycans, often enriched in **glial / perineuronal matrix**. - **MEGF10** – Engulfment receptor enriched in **astrocytes and glia** mediating synaptic pruning and phagocytosis of debris. - **LPL** – Lipoprotein lipase; in the nervous system, enriched in **glial cells (microglia, some oligodendrocytes/Schwann)**, supporting lipid uptake/remodeling for myelin. - **SPP1** – Osteopontin; in the nervous system, a marker of **activated glia** (notably microglia, also some reactive astrocytes/Schwann-like cells). Its presence suggests an **activated/repair** state rather than a macrophage identity given the rest of the program. - **SFRP5 / WNT6** – Wnt pathway modulators; Wnt–Sfrp signaling is active in **neural crest–derived glia and their progenitors**, including Schwann and enteric glial lineages. **B. Synaptic / neuronal-adhesion / neuron–glia interaction genes** These indicate intimate association with neuronal structures (peripheral nerves or enteric plexus). - **NRXN1, NRXN3** – Neurexins; key synaptic adhesion molecules. Classically neuronal, but their high expression in this cluster combined with strong glial genes suggests **close neuron–glia synaptic interfaces** (as seen in peripheral nerve/ENS glia). - **L1CAM, CHL1, CADM2, CRTAC1, SLITRK2, FLRT1** – Cell adhesion molecules and synaptic organizers, all strongly enriched in **neuronal circuits** and associated **glial–axon interactions** (axon guidance, fasciculation, synaptic stabilization). - **SYT10** – Synaptotagmin 10, calcium sensor in synaptic vesicle exocytosis; usually neuronal, indicating **synaptic vesicle cycling** or neuron-proximal signaling. - **GRIK3** – Ionotropic glutamate receptor kainate 3; mostly neuronal, but sometimes expressed at lower levels in neuron-associated glia. - **GFRA2** – GDNF family receptor α2; involved in **GDNF-mediated neuron–glia signaling** in peripheral and enteric nervous system. - **TUBB2B** – β-tubulin isotype enriched in developing **neurons and glia**, associated with neurite extension and process formation. These genes indicate the cells are **deeply embedded in neural circuits**, rather than being generic stromal or immune cells of the gut. **C. Neural crest / glial stem/progenitor–associated transcription factors** - **SOX10** – Master regulator of **neural crest–derived glial lineages**, including **Schwann cells and enteric glia**, and CNS oligodendrocytes. Absolutely defining for peripheral glia in gut scRNA-seq datasets. - **SOX2** – Stem/progenitor TF, including **neural stem cells and glial progenitors**; in the peripheral nervous system and ENS, marks **multipotent neural crest–derived progenitors and some enteric glial subpopulations**. - **FOXD3** – Canonical **neural crest progenitor** transcription factor, particularly in early Schwann and enteric glial lineages. - **FOXD3-AS1** – Antisense transcript associated with FOXD3 locus, reinforces neural crest lineage context. - **ZNF536** – Zinc-finger protein enriched in **neural progenitors and neurons**, involved in neurodevelopment and differentiation. This TF combination is highly characteristic of **neural crest–derived glial cells / their progenitors**, not typical gut epithelium, fibroblasts, immune cells, or smooth muscle. **D. Other neural / nervous system–associated genes** - **L1CAM, CHL1, IGSF11, CADM2** – Ig superfamily molecules; strongly enriched in nervous system (neurons and glia) and peripheral nerve. - **MYOT (myotilin)** – Classically muscle cytoskeletal protein, but low-level expression has been observed in some **peripheral nerve/Schwann-like** cell populations in high-depth scRNA-seq; at minimum, it does **not override** the dominant neural crest/glial program. - **CR TAC1** – Cartilage acidic protein, but also detectable in **CNS/ENS glia** in several atlases. - **TMEM132B, TTYH1, KCNMB4, CHADL, FAM19A5** – All have enriched expression in **CNS/PNS neuronal–glial compartments** in human/mouse atlases (often in OPCs, astrocytes, or specific neuronal subtypes). **E. Likely ambient/contamination markers** - **FGFBP2** – Strong signature gene of **cytotoxic NK / CD8 T cells**. Its appearance as a single marker at the bottom in a clearly neural crest/glial program is best interpreted as **low-level contamination / ambient RNA / rare doublet**, not a true functional program in this cluster. --- 2. Key cell-type marker groups (tissue-level interpretation) From the perspective of gut tissue cell types: **A. Non-epithelial profile** - No high expression of canonical intestinal epithelial markers (e.g. EPCAM, KRT8/18/20, MUC2, LGR5, VIL1, FABP1/2, CDX2). - Absence of typical colon fibroblast / myofibroblast / smooth muscle markers (COL1A1, COL3A1, DCN, ACTA2, MYH11, TAGLN). - Absence of endothelial (PECAM1, VWF, KDR) or canonical immune markers beyond single FGFBP2. This rules out the major non-neuronal gut lineages. **B. Strong neural crest–derived glial signature** Key ENS/peripheral glial markers present: - **SOX10+, PLP1+, CDH19+, CMTM5+, ATP1A2+, PTPRZ1+** – canonical combination for **myelinating glia / OPC-like glia** in many scRNA-seq atlases. - **L1CAM, CHL1, NRXN1/3, CADM2, CRTAC1, GJC3** – neuron-associated adhesion and communication genes, consistent with **glia ensheathing and interacting with axons**. - **FOXD3, SOX2, ZNF536** – neural crest / neural progenitor TFs often retained in **enteric glia and Schwann-like cells**. In human colon and small intestine scRNA-seq references (e.g., HCA colon, Azimuth gut reference, Tabula Sapiens), the **PLP1+ SOX10+ ATP1A2+** clusters are consistently annotated as **enteric glia / peripheral glia (Schwann-like)**. **C. Not a pure neuronal cluster** We see **some neuronal markers** (NRXN1/3, SYT10, GRIK3, CADM2), but: - Lack of strong “pan-neuronal” structural markers like **RBFOX3 (NeuN), SNAP25, STMN2, TUBB3, MAP2, SLC17A7, GAD1/2, TH, CHAT** at the top of the marker list. - Presence of multiple classical **glial regulators (SOX10, PLP1, ATP1A2, PTPRZ1, MEGF10, CMTM5)** that are not typically dominant in pure neuronal clusters. This argues we are seeing a **glial population intimately associated with neurons** rather than neurons themselves. --- 3. Cross-referencing with scRNA-seq atlases and literature Using established references (knowledge as of 2024): - **Human Colon / Intestine references** - HCA / Azimuth colon: Peripheral glial clusters annotated as **“Enteric glia / Schwann cells”** are **SOX10+, PLP1+, ATP1A2+, PTPRZ1+, S100B+/FABP7+**. Some subclusters express **CDH19, CMTM5** and synaptic-adjacent genes (NRXN’s, CADM2), corresponding to **ENS glial populations and extrinsic nerve Schwann cells**. - Tabula Sapiens gut datasets similarly identify a SOX10/PLP1 glial group labeled **“enteric glia/peripheral glia”**. - **CNS/PNS atlases** - Brain atlases (Tasic, Hodge, HCA brain): **PLP1, CMTM5, CDH19, PTPRZ1** co-mark **OPCs and oligodendrocytes**. However, **oligodendrocytes are essentially absent from gut tissue**; the only neural crest–derived glia in intestine are **enteric glia and Schwann cells of extrinsic nerves**. - Peripheral nerve / DRG scRNA-seq (e.g., Furlan et al.) show **CDH19, PLP1, SOX10** in **myelinating Schwann cells**, with overlapping marker sets. Given the **tissue context (large intestine)** + **glial marker pattern** + **neuron-associated adhesion genes**, the canonical match in these references is a **peripheral glial population associated with the enteric nervous system**, typically annotated as **enteric glia or Schwann-like cells**. --- 4. Most probable general cell type **General cell type: Neural crest–derived glial cells of the enteric/peripheral nervous system** Within large intestine, that corresponds broadly to: - **Enteric glial cells** in the myenteric and submucosal plexus, and/or - **Peripheral Schwann cells** associated with extrinsic sympathetic/parasympathetic nerve fibers. The **SOX10+/PLP1+/CDH19+/ATP1A2+/PTPRZ1+** profile in gut is highly characteristic of **enteric/peripheral glia rather than neurons or other stromal/immune cell types**. --- 5. Top 3 most probable sub–cell types (ranked) **1) Enteric glial cells (ENS glia; SOX10⁺ PLP1⁺ ATP1A2⁺, Schwann cell–like)** – **Most likely** Rationale: - This is the canonical annotation for **SOX10+/PLP1+** cells in multiple colon scRNA-seq atlases. - The combination of **SOX10 | Final Annotation Agent: …continuing from your step 5: --- 5. Top 3 most probable sub–cell types (ranked) **General class (agreed): neural crest–derived peripheral/enteric glia** Within this class, the marker combination and tissue context argue for the following hierarchy: --- ### 1) Enteric glial cells (ENS glia; SOX10⁺ PLP1⁺ ATP1A2⁺) – **Most likely** **Why this fits best in large intestine:** - **Canonical ENS glial TF/core markers:** - **SOX10** – obligatory neural crest glial TF; robustly marks enteric glia in gut atlases. - **ATP1A2** – glial Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase isoform; strongly expressed in ENS glia, helps buffer extracellular K⁺ and neurotransmitter-induced ion fluxes. - **PLP1, CMTM5, CDH19** – expressed by **PLP1⁺ enteric glia/peripheral glia** in human colon datasets (Azimuth/HCA, Tabula Sapiens) often annotated collectively as “enteric/peripheral glia”. - **Neuron-contact / plexus-associated phenotype:** - **NRXN1/3, L1CAM, CHL1, CADM2, CRTAC1, SLITRK2, FLRT1, GJC3, GFRA2** – a strong adhesion/neuron–glia interaction program characteristic of cells physically embedded in myenteric/submucosal plexuses and nerve bundles. - This is exactly the profile seen in **myenteric and submucosal enteric glia**, which ensheath neuronal cell bodies and fibers rather than existing as free stromal cells. - **Neural crest/progenitor flavor within ENS glia:** - **SOX2, FOXD3, ZNF536, FOXD3-AS1** – neural crest / neural progenitor TFs often retained in subsets of **ENS glia** that are more plastic, particularly in human datasets where developmental programs remain partially active. - **Gut context constraint:** - In large intestine preparations, these SOX10⁺PLP1⁺ clusters are routinely annotated as **“enteric glial cells” or “peripheral glia (enteric/Schwann-like)”**, rather than pure Schwann cells or CNS oligodendrocytes, because oligodendrocytes are absent and isolated Schwann-only bundles are relatively underrepresented compared to ENS plexuses. **Interpretation:** The most parsimonious and reference-consistent label is **Enteric glial cells (ENS glia, Schwann-like)**, likely enriched for plexus-associated glia (myenteric/submucosal) rather than mucosal fibroblast-like glia. --- ### 2) Schwann cells of extrinsic nerve fibers (myelinating/non-myelinating Schwann cells) – **Second most likely** There is a non-trivial argument that this cluster could instead (or additionally) represent Schwann cells on extrinsic autonomic or sensory fibers coursing through the gut wall: - **Strong Schwann/myelinating-glia signatures:** - **CDH19** – very characteristic of **peripheral myelinating Schwann cells** in peripheral nerve and DRG scRNA-seq. - **PLP1, CMTM5** – robust in **myelinating glia** (CNS oligodendrocytes and PNS Schwann cells). - **L1CAM, CHL1, NRXN1/3, CADM2** – highly expressed in peripheral nerve tracts and Schwann–axon complexes. - **Neural crest TFs supporting Schwann identity:** - **SOX10, FOXD3, SOX2** – canonical for Schwann cell lineage and its progenitors, in addition to enteric glia. - **Why this is ranked second, not first:** - In colon scRNA-seq, Schwann cells of extrinsic nerves and ENS glia often **co-cluster and share a very similar marker set**. - When annotation is forced, datasets frequently label these as “peripheral glia / enteric glia / Schwann cells” as a combined compartment. - Given bulk tissue sampling from **large intestine**, ENS glia numerically dominate over isolated extrinsic Schwann cells, so a pure “Schwann cell only” interpretation is less likely than a mixed or ENS-dominated peripheral glia population. **Interpretation:** The cluster may include or closely resemble **Schwann cells of extrinsic innervation**, but in the colonic context this is typically merged into the broader **enteric/peripheral glia** annotation. --- ### 3) Neural crest–derived glial progenitors / OPC-like peripheral glia – **Third most likely** A third possibility is that this cluster corresponds to a **more progenitor-like glial state** within the ENS/peripheral glia compartment: - Supporting features: - **SOX2, FOXD3, ZNF536, PTPRZ1** – associated with **neural progenitors / OPC-like states** in CNS and with more plastic neural crest glial precursors in PNS. - **TUBB2B, MEGF10, TMEM132B, TTYH1** – enriched in developing neural/glial populations and remodeling glia. - Expression of **SPP1** and **LPL** hints at an **activated or remodeling phenotype**, possibly involved in injury/repair or structural plasticity of the ENS. - Arguments against this as the primary interpretation: - Clear expression of mature/peripheral glial structural and adhesion genes (NRXN1/3, CADM2, L1CAM, PLP1, CMTM5) suggests a **functionally differentiated glial cell** maintaining axon–glia interfaces, not a purely cycling or migratory progenitor pool. - No obvious proliferative signature markers (e.g. **MKI67, TOP2A**) among the top markers. **Interpretation:** More plausibly, this cluster represents **mature peripheral/enteric glia with a retained progenitor-like transcriptional program**, rather than a dedicated progenitor-only compartment. --- ### Most likely subtype annotation Considering: - Tissue: **human large intestine** - Marker set: **SOX10⁺, PLP1⁺, CDH19⁺, CMTM5⁺, ATP1A2⁺, PTPRZ1⁺, NRXN1/3⁺, L1CAM⁺, CHL1⁺, CADM2⁺, GFRA2⁺, SFRP5/WNT6⁺, MEGF10⁺** - Absence of epithelial, stromal, immune, or endothelial signatures The most appropriate, atlas-consistent annotation is: > **Enteric glial cell / peripheral glia (Schwann-like ENS glia)** If you need a single label for downstream analysis, I would use: > **“Enteric glia (SOX10⁺ PLP1⁺)”** to align with most colon scRNA-seq references, while noting in metadata that these are **Schwann-like peripheral glia associated with ENS and extrinsic nerve fibers**. --- 6. Concise summary of analysis - The cluster is dominated by **neural crest–derived glial markers** (SOX10, SOX2, FOXD3, PLP1, CMTM5, CDH19, ATP1A2, PTPRZ1, MEGF10, GJC3, LPL) with **strong neuron-contact adhesion and synaptic-associated genes** (NRXN1/3, L1CAM, CHL1, CADM2, CRTAC1, FLRT1, SLITRK2, GFRA2, TUBB2B). - No intestinal epithelial, fibroblast, smooth muscle, endothelial, or canonical immune programs are present, excluding those lineages. - Cross-referencing gut and brain scRNA-seq atlases indicates this pattern is highly characteristic of **enteric/peripheral glia in the colon**, often annotated as **enteric glia / Schwann cells**. - Among possible subtypes, **enteric glial cells (ENS glia, Schwann-like) > extrinsic Schwann cells > glial progenitor-like cells** is the most reasonable ranking. **Final cell-type annotation for this cluster:** **Enteric glial cells (SOX10⁺ PLP1⁺ peripheral/Schwann-like glia of the ENS).** FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED | Coupling Validator: Validation result: VALIDATION PASSED | Formatting Agent: ```json { ""main_cell_type"": ""Neural crest–derived glial cells of the enteric/peripheral nervous system"", ""sub_cell_types"": [ ""Enteric glial cells (ENS glia; SOX10⁺ PLP1⁺ ATP1A2⁺)"", ""Schwann cells of extrinsic nerve fibers (myelinating/non-myelinating Schwann cells)"", ""Neural crest–derived glial progenitors / OPC-like peripheral glia"" ], ""possible_mixed_cell_types"": [ ""Enteric glia / Schwann cells"", ""Enteric/peripheral glia (Schwann-like ENS glia)"" ] } ```"

Key functional markers and their roles - Immunoglobulin genes (hallmark of antibody-secreting cells) - Heavy chain: **IGHG1, IGHG3, IGHM, IGHA1, IGHA2, IGHV3-7, IGHV3-23, IGHV3-74** - High-level expression of multiple constant regions (γ, μ, α) and diverse V segments indicates cells fully engaged in high-rate antibody production, not naive/memory B cells. - Light chain κ/λ: **IGKC, IGKV4-1, IGKV1-5, IGKV3-20, IGLL5, IGLC2, IGLC3, IGLV6-57, IGLV3-1, IGLV2-11** - Intense expression of both κ and λ light chains (plus IGLL5) is typical of mature plasma cells where Ig transcription dominates the transcriptome. - Secretory apparatus / unfolded protein response - **MZB1** – ER-resident co-chaperone that facilitates Ig heavy chain assembly; strongly enriched in plasmablasts/plasma cells. - **DERL3** – ER-associated degradation component, supports high secretory load. - **TXNDC5** – ER protein disulfide isomerase-like, involved in oxidative folding of secreted proteins. - Collectively these point to a cell highly specialized for secretion with expanded ER. - Polymeric Ig formation and mucosal immunity - **JCHAIN (J chain)** – required for polymerization of IgA and IgM and for binding to the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) for transcytosis across epithelium. Highly characteristic of mucosal plasma cells secreting dimeric IgA and pentameric IgM. - TNF-family signaling / plasma cell survival - **TNFRSF17 (BCMA)** – canonical receptor on plasma cells mediating survival signals from BAFF/APRIL; a gold-standard marker for antibody-secreting cells. - Chemokines / chemokine receptors - **CCR10** – chemokine receptor for CCL27/CCL28; critical for homing of IgA-secreting cells to mucosal sites (including colon). Strongly associated with mucosal IgA plasma cells. - **CCL3** – inflammatory chemokine (MIP-1α), often up in activated B/plasma cells and can be a feature of plasmablast-like or inflammatory ASCs. - Other immune/function-associated genes - **FCRL5** – Fc receptor–like 5; typically enriched in antigen-experienced B cell subsets, including age-associated B cells and some plasma cell subsets. - **APOBEC3A** – cytidine deaminase; often interferon-inducible, seen in activated myeloid and some activated B/ASC states; suggests an inflammatory/IFN-exposed environment. - **LILRB4 (ILT3)** – inhibitory receptor more classical in myeloid/dendritic cells but can appear in tolerogenic or specialized immune subsets; here likely secondary/low-level. 2. Key cell-type–defining markers and their meaning - Plasma cell / antibody-secreting cell markers - Massive immunoglobulin transcription: **IGHG1, IGHG3, IGHM, IGHA1, IGHA2, IGKC, IGLC2, IGLC3, etc.** – signature of plasma cells rather than naive or memory B cells (where Ig genes are abundant but not so overwhelmingly dominant). - **JCHAIN** – specific for secretory IgA/IgM production; plasma cell hallmark in mucosal tissue. - **MZB1, DERL3, TXNDC5** – classic secretory/plasma cell machinery genes. - **TNFRSF17 (BCMA)** – highly characteristic of plasmablasts/plasma cells; not expressed on naive B cells and weak on most memory B cells. Together, these markers tightly define the cluster as antibody-secreting cells / plasma cells (ASCs), not memory or naive B cells. - Mucosal / IgA plasma cell markers - **IGHA1, IGHA2** – strong representation of α constant regions compatible with IgA-secreting ASCs. - **JCHAIN** – required for dimeric IgA, a defining feature of mucosal antibody responses. - **CCR10** – classical marker of IgA+ mucosal plasma cells (CCR10–CCL28 axis driving homing to colon and other mucosae). 3. Cross-reference with scRNA-seq databases and literature - Human colon / intestine references (e.g., HCA Gut Cell Atlas, Smillie et al. Cell 2019, Martin et al. Nature 2019, Azimuth/Seurat colon references) consistently annotate clusters with: - Extremely high Ig gene expression (various IGH/IGK/IGL), **MZB1**, **JCHAIN**, **TNFRSF17**, **XBP1/PRDM1** (the latter not listed here but typically present) as **plasma cells / plasmablasts**. - **CCR10+ IGHA1/2+ JCHAIN+** clusters in colon are specifically labeled as **mucosal IgA plasma cells**. - Databases like CellTypist, SingleR using human PBMC + tissue B cell references: - A combination of **TNFRSF17, MZB1, JCHAIN, high Ig constant regions** maps robustly to ""plasmablast"", ""plasma cell"", or ""antibody-secreting cell"" annotations. - The overlap of **CCR10 + IGHA1/IGHA2 + JCHAIN** is classic for **colonic lamina propria IgA-secreting plasma cells**, which dominate B-lineage cells in large intestine. 4. Most probable general cell type Given: - Dominant immune-globulin expression (heavy and light chains). - Presence of **JCHAIN**, **MZB1**, and **TNFRSF17**. - Absence (in the marker list) of canonical naive/memory B-cell-surface markers (MS4A1/CD20, CCR7, etc.) but instead a heavily secretory transcriptional program. → The general cell type is: **Plasma cell / antibody-secreting cell (ASC)**. 5. Top 3 most probable sub–cell-type annotations (ranked) Within plasma cells from large intestine, plausible subtypes based on these markers: **1) Mucosal IgA-secreting plasma cells (CCR10+ IgA+ JCHAIN+ ASCs)** – most likely - Supporting markers: - **IGHA1, IGHA2** – strong IgA usage. - **JCHAIN** – dimeric IgA production. - **CCR10** – gut/mucosal homing chemokine receptor; canonical for IgA+ plasma cells in colon and other mucosae. - **TNFRSF17, MZB1, DERL3, TXNDC5** – defining plasma cell machinery and survival. - Context: Large intestine lamina propria is dominated by IgA-secreting CCR10+ JCHAIN+ plasma cells that provide mucosal immunity (often identified as ""IgA plasma cells"" in colon atlases). - The co-expression of IgG and IgM genes is not unusual in a plasma-cell cluster; single-cell clusters can include multiple isotypes, but the combination of strong IgA + JCHAIN + CCR10 in colon strongly biases toward mucosal IgA ASCs as the primary identity. **2) Class-switched IgG/IgM plasma cells (non-IgA dominant ASCs)** – second most likely - Supporting markers: - **IGHG1, IGHG3, IGHM** alongside IgA genes. - Same plasma cell machinery (**TNFRSF17, MZB1, DERL3**). - Some colonic ASCs are IgG+ or IgM+ (responding to systemic or localized inflammation). - If the underlying data showed relatively stronger IGHG/IGHM than IGHA, this would argue for an IgG/IgM plasma cell subset; however, the presence of CCR10 and JCHAIN is more stereotypical of IgA mucosal cells, so this is considered secondary. **3) Activated/inflammatory plasmablast-like plasma cells** – third most likely - Supporting markers: - **CCL3** – produced by activated B cells/plasmablasts in inflammatory conditions. - **APOBEC3A** – IFN- and inflammation-associated; can mark activated ASCs, especially in inflamed tissue. - **FCRL5** – associated with antigen-experienced B-lineage states (e.g., age-associated B cells) and some inflammatory plasma cell subsets. - In the context of gut inflammation (e.g., IBD), one often sees more proliferative / plasmablast-like populations with such signatures. - However, the marker set lacks strong proliferation markers (MKI67, TOP2A, etc.), so I would not prioritize plasmablast over mature tissue plasma cell as the primary annotation. **Most likely subtype:** **CCR10+ IgA-secreting mucosal plasma cell** (JCHAIN+ IgA ASC from colonic lamina propria). 6. Concise summary - The cluster shows overwhelmingly high expression of diverse Ig heavy and light chain genes (IGHG1, IGHA1/2, IGHM, IGKC, IGLC2/3, etc.), together with **JCHAIN**, **MZB1**, and **TNFRSF17**, unequivocally identifying it as a **plasma cell / antibody-secreting cell** population. - The co-expression of **IGHA1, IGHA2, JCHAIN, and CCR10** in large intestine strongly indicates **mucosal IgA-secreting plasma cells** homing to and residing in the colonic lamina propria. - Additional markers (**CCL3, APOBEC3A, FCRL5**) suggest some degree of activation/inflammation but do not override the dominant mucosal IgA plasma cell identity. **Final annotation:** - General: **Plasma cell / antibody-secreting cell (ASC)** - Specific: **CCR10+ IgA-secreting mucosal plasma cell (JCHAIN+ colonic lamina propria plasma cell)** FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED | Coupling Validator: Validation result: VALIDATION PASSED | Formatting Agent: ```json { ""main_cell_type"": ""Plasma cell / antibody-secreting cell (ASC)"", ""sub_cell_types"": [ ""Mucosal IgA-secreting plasma cells (CCR10+ IgA+ JCHAIN+ ASCs)"", ""Class-switched IgG/IgM plasma cells (non-IgA dominant ASCs)"", ""Activated/inflammatory plasmablast-like plasma cells"" ], ""possible_mixed_cell_types"": [] } ```"

Key cell-type–relevant markers and their implications There are essentially **no classical lineage markers** (no EPCAM, KRT8/18, CD3D, CD79A, COL1A1, PECAM1, etc.) in this *top* ranked list. Instead we see: - **MKI67, TOP2A, UBE2C, BIRC5, FOXM1, CCNB2, CCNA2, CDK1** - These are used across atlases (HPCA, PanglaoDB, Human Cell Atlas, Tabula Sapiens) to define “**cycling_*X* cells**” (cycling epithelial, cycling T, cycling B, cycling endothelial, etc.). - On their own, they **do not encode lineage**, only proliferative state. - Given the tissue context – **large intestine** – and typical scRNA architecture: - Crypt **transit-amplifying (TA) epithelial cells** and **stem/progenitor cells** are the dominant proliferative population, and they characteristically show exactly this gene set as their top DEGs relative to the rest of the epithelium. - Proliferating immune cells (cycling T/B) usually show **CD3D/E, TRAC, IL7R, CCR7** (T) or **MS4A1, CD79A/B, MSA4A1, MZB1, IGKC** (B/plasma) among their markers—even if diluted by cell-cycle genes—and those are not present here (at least not in the top list). - Proliferating stromal/endothelial cells usually retain **COL1A1/COL1A2, VWF/PECAM1, ACTA2**, etc. – again absent from this top list. Given that this list reflects *ranked* genes for the cluster, the dominance of cell-cycle genes and absence of alternative lineage markers strongly suggests **proliferating crypt epithelial cells** (most often labeled as “transit amplifying” in colon atlases) rather than proliferating immune or stromal populations. --- 3. Cross-reference with known scRNA-seq atlases and literature - **Smillie et al., Cell 2019 (Human colon epithelium atlas)** - Their “**TA cells**” and “**cycling epithelial cells**” clusters are defined by high expression of **MKI67, TOP2A, UBE2C, BIRC5, CCNB2, CDK1, CENPA, PLK1, AURKB** – *exactly overlapping* this set. - Stem cell clusters (LGR5+ CBC) show Wnt targets (**LGR5, ASCL2, SMOC2, AXIN2, OLFM4**) together with *some* proliferation markers, but the very top markers skew more toward stemness/Wnt than pure cell-cycle. Those are missing here. - **Tabula Sapiens (human multi-organ atlas)** - “**Cycling epithelial cell**” clusters across gut regions are annotated by enrichment of **MKI67, TOP2A, CCNB2, UBE2C, BIRC5, SPC25, KIF2C** and similar G2/M genes. - They typically appear as “cycling epithelial” rather than separate lineages, in line with what we see here. - **PanglaoDB / CellMarker / HPCA** - Gene sets for “**proliferating cells**”, “**G2/M cell cycle**” and “**transit-amplifying intestinal cells**” are enriched for many of the same genes: **MKI67, TOP2A, BIRC5, UBE2C, CCNB2, CENPA, PLK1, AURKB, RAD51AP1, TK1, RRM2, CDC45, CDT1**. - These genes are agnostic to the cell-lineage context but, when combined with tissue annotation (“colon/large intestine”), they are canonically assigned to crypt TA epithelial cells. - **Seurat and other scRNA tools** - Many of these genes (CDK1, CCNB2, TOP2A, MKI67, UBE2C, BIRC5, CENPA, NUF2, SPC24, SPC25) are part of the standard Seurat **G2M.Score** gene set. The profile screams **G2/M cycling epithelium**. Taken together, database cross-references indicate a **“cycling / transit-amplifying intestinal epithelial”** phenotype as the dominant interpretation in a large intestine dataset. --- 4. Most probable general cell type Given: - The dataset is from **human large intestine**. - The marker list is **pure cell-cycle/mitotic** without immune, stromal, or endothelial lineage markers. - In colon scRNA-seq, the primary highly proliferative compartment is the **crypt epithelium** (stem + TA cells), with TA cells being especially enriched for this “pure cycling” signature. **Most probable general cell type:** > **Cycling intestinal epithelial cells (crypt progenitor/TA compartment)** I would annotate the general type as: **“Proliferating / cycling epithelial cells (G2/M) from intestinal crypts”**. --- 5. Top 3 most probable sub cell types (ranked) Within the general class “intestinal epithelial cells,” and constrained by the marker set: 1. **Cycling transit-amplifying (TA) epithelial cells of the colonic crypt** – **most likely** - Justification: - TA cells in colon atlases are defined almost entirely by the same suite of **G2/M and S-phase genes** with high MKI67, TOP2A, UBE2C, BIRC5, CENPA, CDK1, PLK1, AURKB, etc. - They often lack strong expression of mature lineage markers and are heavily dominated by cell-cycle genes in DE analysis, just as observed here. - Wnt/stemness markers (LGR5, ASCL2, OLFM4, SMOC2, AXIN2) are *usually* more prominent in stem cell clusters than in TA clusters; their absence here aligns better with TA than with stem cells. 2. **Cycling intestinal stem cells (crypt base columnar, CBC)** – possible but less likely - Justification: - CBC stem cells are also cycling, often G1/S-enriched, and do express many of the same genes (MKI67, TOP2A, BIRC5, etc.), but their top markers generally include classic Wnt/stemness genes. - The marker list provided is almost exclusively **cell-cycle**, without obvious stemness/Wnt bias. - Thus, while some fraction of these cells may biologically be stem cells, the *cluster-level signature* fits TA better. 3. **Cycling immune or stromal cells (e.g., proliferating T cells, B cells, fibroblasts, endothelial)** – less likely - Justification: - Proliferating T cells would show: **CD3D/E, TRAC, IL7R, CCR7, CXCR4**, etc. - Proliferating B/plasma cells: **CD79A/B, MS4A1, MZB1, IGKC/IGHG**, etc. - Proliferating fibroblasts: **COL1A1, COL1A2, DCN**, etc. - Proliferating endothelial: **PECAM1, VWF, KDR**, etc. - None of these lineage-defining genes appear among the top-ranked markers; in most atlases, even in cycling clusters, at least some lineage markers remain high in the top DE genes. - Hence, these interpretations are less consistent with the data. **Most likely subtype annotation:** > **Cycling transit-amplifying epithelial cells (G2/M-enriched crypt progenitors) of the human large intestine** --- 6. Concise summary - The marker list is dominated by **G2/M and S-phase cell-cycle genes** (CDK1, CCNB2, CCNA2, PLK1, AURKB, CENPA, NUF2, SPC24/25, MKI67, TOP2A, UBE2C, BIRC5, RRM2, TK1, CDT1, GINS2, RAD51AP1, POLQ, FOXM1, etc.), with **no obvious immune, stromal, or endothelial lineage markers**. - This is the canonical signature of **highly proliferative cells** and closely matches “**cycling epithelial / transit-amplifying cells**” clusters from published human colon atlases (e.g., Smillie et al., Tabula Sapiens). - Given the tissue source (large intestine) and known biology of the colonic crypt, the | Final Annotation Agent: …Given the tissue source (large intestine) and known biology of the colonic crypt, the most coherent interpretation is that this cluster represents **crypt epithelial progenitors in an active G2/M cell-cycle state**, i.e. the **transit-amplifying compartment** rather than differentiated or non-epithelial lineages. **Final annotation** - **General cell type:** - Intestinal epithelial cells (large intestine), **cycling / proliferative** - **Most probable subtype (ranked)** 1. **Cycling transit-amplifying (TA) epithelial cells, G2/M-enriched** – best fit to the pure cell-cycle signature, matching TA clusters in human colon atlases. 2. Cycling intestinal stem (CBC) cells – possible but less likely due to absence of prominent Wnt/stemness markers (LGR5, ASCL2, OLFM4, SMOC2, AXIN2). 3. Other cycling lineages (immune, stromal, endothelial) – unlikely given the lack of canonical lineage markers (CD3D/E, CD79A, COL1A1, PECAM1, etc.). **Concise label to use in the object metadata:** > **“Cycling transit-amplifying epithelial cells (G2/M, colonic crypt)”** FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED | Coupling Validator: Validation result: VALIDATION PASSED | Formatting Agent: ```json { ""main_cell_type"": ""Cycling intestinal epithelial cells (crypt progenitor/TA compartment)"", ""sub_cell_types"": [ ""Cycling transit-amplifying (TA) epithelial cells of the colonic crypt"", ""Cycling intestinal stem cells (crypt base columnar, CBC)"", ""Cycling immune or stromal cells (e.g., proliferating T cells, B cells, fibroblasts, endothelial)"" ], ""possible_mixed_cell_types"": [ ""Cycling transit-amplifying (TA) epithelial cells of the colonic crypt and cycling intestinal stem cells (crypt base columnar, CBC)"" ] } ```"
