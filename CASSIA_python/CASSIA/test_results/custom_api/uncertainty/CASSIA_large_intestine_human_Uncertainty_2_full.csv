List the Key Cell Type Markers** These markers strongly suggest **cytotoxic lymphocytes**, specifically **NK cells and CD8+ T cells**: - **NK Cell-Associated Markers:** - *KLRC2 (NKG2C), KLRD1 (CD94), KLRK1 (NKG2D), NKG7, PRF1, GZMB* - *XCL1, XCL2* (Chemokines secreted by NK cells) - **CD8+ T Cell-Associated Markers:** - *CD8A, CD8B, GZMK, IFNG, CCL5* - *TIGIT, LAG3, TNFRSF9* (Exhaustion/activation markers in CD8+ T cells) - **Gamma-Delta (γδ) T Cell Markers (minor contribution):** - *TRGC1, TRGC2* (TCR gamma chain components) #### **3. Cross-reference Known Databases** - **Human Cell Atlas (HCA), Azimuth, CellMarkerDB, and PanglaoDB** confirm that: - *NKG7, GNLY, PRF1, GZMB, KLRD1* are classic **NK cell markers**. - *CD8A/B, GZMK, IFNG* are **CD8+ T cell markers**. - *TIGIT, LAG3* are associated with **exhausted/cytotoxic CD8+ T cells**. - *TRGC1/2* may indicate a minor γδ T cell population. #### **4. Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type** The **dominant cell type** is **cytotoxic lymphocytes**, with two major possibilities: 1. **Natural Killer (NK) cells** (strong expression of *KLRC2, KLRD1, NKG7, XCL1/2*) 2. **CD8+ cytotoxic T cells** (strong expression of *CD8A/B, GZMK, IFNG*) Given the co-expression of NK and T cell markers, this cluster may represent **NK-like CD8+ T cells** or **activated NK cells**. #### **5. Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types** Ranked from most to least likely: 1. **CD8+ Cytotoxic T Cells (Exhausted/Effector Phenotype)** - Evidence: *CD8A/B, GZMK, IFNG, TIGIT, LAG3, CCL5* - *TIGIT+LAG3+* suggests **exhaustion or tissue-resident memory (TRM) phenotype**. 2. **Natural Killer (NK) Cells (Activated, Tissue-Resident)** - Evidence: *KLRC2, KLRD1, NKG7, XCL1/2, PRF1* - *XCL1/2* suggests **tissue-homing NK cells**. 3. **Gamma-Delta (γδ) T Cells (Minor Population)** - Evidence: *TRGC1, TRGC2* - Weak signal compared to CD8+ T/NK cells. **Final Subtype Decision:** The **strongest evidence** supports **CD8+ cytotoxic T cells with an exhausted/effector phenotype**, given the dominance of *CD8A/B, GZMK, IFNG, TIGIT, LAG3*. However, the presence of *KLRC2, KLRD1, NKG7* suggests some **NK-like features**, possibly indicating **adaptive NK cells or NK-like CD8+ T cells**. #### **6. Concise Summary of Analysis** - **General Cell Type:** Cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells or NK cells). - **Most Likely Subtype:** **Exhausted/Effector CD8+ T Cells** (due to *CD8A/B, GZMK, IFNG, TIGIT, LAG3*). - **Alternative:** **Activated NK Cells** (due to *KLRC2, KLRD1, NKG7, XCL1/2*). - **Minor Population:** Possible γδ T cells (*TRGC1/2*). **FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED** **Most Probable Cell Type:** **Exhausted/Effector CD8+ T Cells** (with NK-like features).

No other cell type in the intestine expresses this combination at high levels. #### 5. **Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types:** 1. **Active Intestinal Stem Cells (LGR5+ ASCL2+)**: The strongest match due to high *LGR5* and *ASCL2* expression. These are the proliferative, Wnt-driven stem cells in the crypt base. 2. **Quiescent Stem Cells (LGR5+ ASCL2-)**: Less likely because *ASCL2* is highly expressed here, suggesting active stemness. 3. **Early Transit-Amplifying Progenitors**: Unlikely because *LGR5* is typically downregulated in this population, but *TDGF1* could hint at a very early progenitor state. **Most Likely Subtype**: **Active LGR5+ ASCL2+ Intestinal Stem Cells**. #### 6. **Concise Summary:** - The cluster is dominated by *LGR5* and *ASCL2*, which are canonical markers for active intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the crypt base of the large intestine. - The presence of *TDGF1* and proliferative-associated pseudogenes further supports a stem/progenitor identity. - No other cell type in the intestine matches this marker profile as closely. ### FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED: **Cell Type**: **Active Intestinal Stem Cells (LGR5+ ASCL2+)** **Tissue**: Large Intestine (Crypt Base) **Key Markers**: *LGR5*, *ASCL2*, *TDGF1* **Confidence**: High (definitive stem cell signature) | Coupling Validator: ### Validation Steps: 1. **Marker Consistency**: - The proposed annotation identifies **Active Intestinal Stem Cells (LGR5+ ASCL2+)** with key markers *LGR5*, *ASCL2*, and *TDGF1*. - All three markers are present in the provided marker list (*LGR5*, *ASCL2*, *TDGF1*). - *LGR5* and *ASCL2* are definitive markers for intestinal stem cells, and *TDGF1* is consistent with stem/progenitor identity. - Additional markers (*IGFBPL1*, *SLC39A2*) are also present and align with metabolic/proliferative activity in stem cells. 2. **Mixed Cell Type Consideration**: - No conflicting markers suggest contamination by another cell type. - The presence of ribosomal pseudogenes (*RPL*, *RPS*) is expected in highly proliferative stem cells and does not indicate a mixed population. ### Validation Result: **VALIDATION PASSED** **Feedback**: - The annotation is strongly supported by canonical intestinal stem cell markers (*LGR5*, *ASCL2*). - No evidence of mixed cell types or contradictory markers. - Confidence in the annotation is high due to the specificity of the top markers. **Optional Suggestion**: - If further validation is desired, check for the absence of mature epithelial markers (*e.g., MUC2*, *LYZ* for goblet/enterocytes) to rule out contamination.

The annotation appropriately notes these as minor alternatives. 4. **Database/Literature Alignment**: - Matches **Human Cell Atlas** and **Tabula Sapiens** references for L-cell markers. - No contradictory markers (e.g., **VIL1** for enterocytes, **LYZ** for Paneth cells) are present. ### **Minor Suggestions for Clarity (Optional):** - If **NEUROD1** or **PROX1** (L-cell-enriched TFs) were detected, their inclusion could strengthen the claim. - A brief note on the absence of **SST** (somatostatin, D-cell marker) could further justify the exclusion of D-cells as the primary subtype. **Conclusion**: The annotation is **biologically valid** and well-supported by the marker list.

While **FCRL5** suggests a memory B cell contribution, the dominance of plasma cell markers (e.g., **JCHAIN, MZB1**) supports a homogeneous **plasma cell** identity. - Minor contaminants (e.g., **MYL2, BMP6, BFSP2**) are likely technical noise or doublets but do not challenge the primary annotation. 3. **Tissue Context Alignment**: - **IgA dominance** fits the expected biology of mucosal plasma cells in the **large intestine**. - **CCL3** and **LILRB4** further support an immune-secretory phenotype. ### **Minor Recommendations (Optional Refinement):** - If further validation is desired, check for **XBP1** (plasma cell ER stress marker) or **CD38** (plasma cell surface marker) in the dataset. - Consider dimensionality reduction (e.g., UMAP) to confirm cluster homogeneity. **Final Verdict**: The annotation is **biologically sound** and aligns with the marker evidence.
