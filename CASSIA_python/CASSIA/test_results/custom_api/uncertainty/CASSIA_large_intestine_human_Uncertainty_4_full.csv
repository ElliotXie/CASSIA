However, a few key functional markers stand out: - **LGR5**: A well-known marker of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and a Wnt target gene critical for stemness in the crypt base. - **ASCL2**: A transcription factor essential for intestinal stem cell maintenance, also regulated by Wnt signaling. - **TDGF1 (Cripto)**: Expressed in stem/progenitor cells and implicated in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. - **SLC39A2 (ZIP2)**: A zinc transporter, potentially linked to proliferative cells.

Key Functional Markers and Their Roles** The marker list is dominated by **immunoglobulin (Ig) genes** and **B-cell/plasma cell-related genes**, indicating a strong association with the **humoral immune response**. Here are the key functional markers grouped by their roles: - **Immunoglobulin Genes (B-cell/Plasma Cell Markers):** - **IGLL5** (Immunoglobulin Lambda Like Polypeptide 5): Essential for B-cell development and pre-B-cell receptor signaling. - **JCHAIN** (Joining Chain of Multimeric IgA and IgM): Critical for polymeric Ig formation (IgA/IgM). - **IGLC2, IGLC3, IGLV6-57, IGLV3-1, IGLV2-11** (Ig Light Chains): Components of antibodies. - **IGKC, IGKV4-1, IGKV1-5, IGKV3-20** (Ig Kappa Light Chains): Alternative light chain components. - **IGHG1, IGHG3, IGHM, IGHA1, IGHA2** (Ig Heavy Chains): Heavy chains for IgG, IgM, and IgA. - **TNFRSF17 (BCMA)**: Receptor for BAFF, critical for plasma cell survival. - **MZB1**: Chaperone for IgM secretion in plasma cells. - **DERL3**: ER-associated degradation (ERAD) component, highly expressed in plasma cells. - **FCRL5 (Fc Receptor-Like 5)**: Expressed in memory B cells and plasma cells. - **Other Immune-Related Genes:** - **CCL3** (Chemokine Ligand 3): Secreted by plasma cells and involved in immune cell recruitment. - **LILRB4** (Leukocyte Ig-Like Receptor B4): Immunoregulatory receptor. - **GPRC5D** (G Protein-Coupled Receptor Class C Group 5 Member D): Expressed in plasma cells. - **Non-Immune Genes (Likely Contaminants or Low Expression):** - **MYL2** (Myosin Light Chain 2): Typically muscle-related (likely background noise). - **BMP6** (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6): Not typical for B/plasma cells (likely low expression). - **AMPD1** (Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase 1): Muscle metabolism (likely noise). #### **2. Key Cell Type Markers and Their Roles** The overwhelming presence of **immunoglobulin genes**, **JCHAIN**, **MZB1**, **TNFRSF17 (BCMA)**, and **DERL3** strongly suggests a **plasma cell** identity. These markers are **highly specific** for terminally differentiated antibody-secreting cells. #### **3. Cross-Referencing Known Databases** - **Human Cell Atlas (HCA)**: Plasma cells in the intestine express **IGHA1, IGHA2, JCHAIN, MZB1, DERL3**. - **ImmGen Database**: Plasma cells are defined by **TNFRSF17 (BCMA), IGKC, IGLC2, IGLC3**. - **Literature**: Gut plasma cells are major producers of **IgA** (IGHA1/IGHA2) and **polymeric IgM** (JCHAIN). #### **4. Most Probable General Cell Type** The **general cell type** is **Plasma Cell** (terminally differentiated B-cell subset specialized in antibody secretion). #### **5. Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types** Given the **intestinal tissue origin**, the most likely **subtypes** are: 1. **IgA+ Plasma Cell (Most Likely)** - **Key Markers**: **IGHA1, IGHA2, JCHAIN, IGLV6-57, IGLV3-1, IGLV2-11** (IgA light chains). - **Rationale**: Dominant in mucosal immunity, especially the gut. 2. **IgG+ Plasma Cell** - **Key Markers**: **IGHG1, IGHG3, IGKC, IGKV4-1, IGKV1-5**. - **Rationale**: Less common in gut but present in systemic immunity. 3. **IgM+ Plasma Cell** - **Key Markers**: **IGHM, JCHAIN, MZB1, DERL3**. - **Rationale**: Early plasma cell response, but less dominant than IgA in gut. **Final Subtype Call**: **IgA+ Plasma Cell** (due to high IGHA1/IGHA2 and gut-specific context). #### **6. Concise Summary of Analysis** - **Dominant Markers**: Immunoglobulin genes (IGHA1, IGHA2, JCHAIN, IGLC2/3, IGLV6-57, MZB1, TNFRSF17, DERL3). - **General Cell Type**: **Plasma Cell** (antibody-secreting B-cell lineage). - **Most Probable Subtype**: **IgA+ Plasma Cell** (gut mucosal immunity). - **Supporting Evidence**: High IgA light/heavy chains, JCHAIN (polymeric IgA), and gut-specific plasma cell markers. **FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED: IgA+ Plasma Cell** (intestinal mucosal plasma cell). | Coupling Validator: Validation result: VALIDATION PASSED ### **Feedback & Justification:** 1. **Marker Consistency:** - The proposed **IgA+ Plasma Cell** annotation is strongly supported by the provided marker list, which includes **IGHA1, IGHA2, JCHAIN, IGLC2/3, IGLV6-57, MZB1, TNFRSF17 (BCMA), DERL3**, and other immunoglobulin genes. These are canonical markers for plasma cells, with **IGHA1/IGHA2** and **JCHAIN** specifically implicating an IgA-secreting subset. - **Immunoglobulin light/heavy chains (IGKC, IGKV, IGLV, IGHG/IGHM)** further reinforce the B-cell lineage and plasma cell identity. 2. **Functional Relevance:** - **Gut-specific context** aligns with the dominance of **IgA-related markers (IGHA1/IGHA2, JCHAIN)**, as mucosal plasma cells primarily secrete polymeric IgA. - **Plasma cell-specific genes (MZB1, DERL3, TNFRSF17)** are present and rank highly, corroborating terminal differentiation. 3. **Potential Noise/Contaminants:** - Non-immune genes (e.g., **MYL2, BMP6, AMPD1**) are correctly flagged as likely background noise due to their irrelevance to plasma cells. 4. **Subtype Specificity:** - The distinction between **IgA+**, **IgG+**, and **IgM+** plasma cells is well-justified, with **IgA+** being the most probable given the tissue context and marker dominance. **Conclusion:** The annotation is biologically sound, marker-supported, and contextually appropriate. No evidence of mixed populations or misclassification. **Suggested Minor Improvement (Optional):** - If additional metadata (e.g., tissue origin = gut) were explicitly provided, the confidence in the **IgA+** subtype call would further increase. However, the current evidence suffices for validation. | Formatting Agent: { 'main_cell_type': 'Plasma Cell', 'sub_cell_types': [ 'IgA+ Plasma Cell', 'IgG+ Plasma Cell', 'IgM+ Plasma Cell' ], 'possible_mixed_cell_types': [], 'num_markers': 50 }"

List the Key Functional Markers** The provided gene list is overwhelmingly dominated by **cell cycle-related genes**, particularly those involved in **mitosis (M phase) and DNA replication (S phase)**. These include: - **Mitotic spindle assembly & chromosome segregation**: `HJURP`, `CENPA`, `KIF2C`, `KIF15`, `KIF18B`, `ASPM`, `NUF2`, `SKA3`, `SKA1`, `TTK`, `PLK1` - **Centrosome & kinetochore function**: `CEP55`, `SPC25`, `SPC24` - **DNA replication & cell cycle progression**: `TOP2A`, `MKI67`, `CDC45`, `RRM2`, `CDK1`, `CDC25C`, `CCNA2`, `CCNB2` - **Mitotic checkpoint & proliferation**: `AURKB`, `BIRC5`, `PBK`, `DLGAP5`, `CDCA5`, `CDCA3` **Conclusion**: This cluster is highly enriched for genes associated with **active cell proliferation**, specifically **G2/M phase transition and mitosis**. --- #### **2. List the Key Cell Type Markers** While most genes are cell cycle-related, some are also associated with specific cell types in the **intestinal epithelium**: - **Stem/progenitor markers**: `MKI67` (proliferating crypt cells), `TOP2A` (cycling cells) - **Enterocyte precursors**: `PKMYT1`, `CDK1` (seen in early differentiating cells) - **General epithelial markers**: `FOXM1` (epithelial proliferation regulator) **Notably absent**: - **Differentiated enterocyte markers** (e.g., `SI`, `FABP1`), - **Goblet cell markers** (e.g., `MUC2`), - **Enteroendocrine markers** (e.g., `CHGA`), - **Paneth cell markers** (e.g., `LYZ`), - **Immune cell markers** (e.g., `PTPRC`). **Conclusion**: The cells are **epithelial** and **proliferating**, likely originating from the **crypt base** (where stem/progenitor cells reside). --- #### **3. Cross-reference Known Databases** - **Human Cell Atlas (HCA)**: Proliferating cells in the intestine express `MKI67`, `TOP2A`, and `CDK1` (consistent with crypt base columnar cells). - **Tabula Sapiens**: `HJURP`, `UBE2C`, and `CENPA` are markers of **transit-amplifying (TA) cells** in the colon. - **Literature**: `FOXM1` and `AURKB` are upregulated in intestinal stem cells and TA cells (PMID: 31067469). **Conclusion**: The markers align with **proliferating epithelial cells** in the intestinal crypt. --- #### **4. Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type** The absence of differentiated cell markers and the strong cell cycle signature suggest: **General cell type**: **Proliferating epithelial cells** (likely **stem/progenitor or transit-amplifying cells**). --- #### **5. Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types** Ranked by likelihood: 1. **Transit-amplifying (TA) cells**: - Highest expression of `MKI67`, `TOP2A`, `CDK1`, and `FOXM1`. - TA cells are rapidly dividing progenitors downstream of stem cells. 2. **Crypt base columnar stem cells (LGR5+)**: - Lower likelihood because `LGR5` is absent, but some markers (e.g., `ASPM`) are shared. - Stem cells divide more slowly than TA cells, so fewer mitotic genes would be expected. 3. **Early enterocyte precursors**: - Some overlap with `PKMYT1` and `CDCA3`, but lacks mature enterocyte markers. **Most likely subtype**: **Transit-amplifying (TA) cells**. --- #### **6. Concise Summary** - **Key markers**: Dominated by **cell cycle (G2/M phase)** and **proliferation** genes (`MKI67`, `TOP2A`, `CDK1`). - **Cell type**: **Proliferating epithelial cells** in the intestinal crypt. - **Subtype**: **Transit-amplifying (TA) cells** (most likely), with lower probabilities for stem cells or early precursors. - **Validation**: Consistent with HCA and Tabula Sapiens references. **FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED**: **Transit-amplifying (TA) cells of the intestinal crypt**. --- **Feedback incorporation**: If additional markers (e.g., `LGR5`, `OLFM4`) were provided, we could refine further.
