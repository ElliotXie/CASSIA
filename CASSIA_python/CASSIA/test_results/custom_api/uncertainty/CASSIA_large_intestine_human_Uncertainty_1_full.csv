List the Key Functional Markers:** The provided list contains a mix of **protein-coding genes** and **pseudogenes**. The most notable **functional markers** are: - **LGR5**: A well-known marker for **intestinal stem cells (ISCs)**.

Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type:** The **strong expression of LGR5, ASCL2, and TDGF1** strongly suggests that this cluster represents **intestinal epithelial stem/progenitor cells**. #### **5. Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types:** Given the markers, the most likely **subtypes** (ranked by likelihood) are: 1. **Active Intestinal Stem Cells (LGR5+ ASCL2+)** – Highest likelihood due to co-expression of **LGR5** and **ASCL2**. 2. **Early Progenitor Cells (LGR5low ASCL2+ TDGF1+)** – Possible transitional state between stem and TA (transit-amplifying) cells. 3. **Quiescent Stem Cells (LGR5+ ASCL2low)** – Less likely since **ASCL2** is highly expressed, suggesting active proliferation. **Final Subtype Annotation:** **Active LGR5+ Intestinal Stem Cells (ISCs)** – The dominant phenotype based on high **LGR5** and **ASCL2**. #### **6. Concise Summary of Analysis:** - **Key markers (LGR5, ASCL2, TDGF1)** strongly indicate **intestinal stem cells**. - **Pseudogenes** suggest high transcriptional activity, consistent with a **proliferative stem cell state**. - **No differentiation markers** are present, ruling out mature epithelial subtypes. - **Most probable subtype:** **Active LGR5+ ASCL2+ Intestinal Stem Cells**. **FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED** **Cell Type:** **Intestinal Stem Cells (ISCs)** **Subtype:** **Active LGR5+ ASCL2+ ISCs** (most likely), with possible early progenitor contribution. | Coupling Validator: ### Validation Result: **VALIDATION PASSED** #### **Justification:** 1. **Marker Consistency:** - The proposed annotation (**Active LGR5+ ASCL2+ Intestinal Stem Cells**) is strongly supported by the presence of **LGR5** and **ASCL2** in the marker list, which are canonical markers for intestinal stem cells. - **TDGF1**, another key marker mentioned, is also present in the list and aligns with a stem/progenitor phenotype. - **SLC39A2** (a zinc transporter) and **KRT8P13** (pseudogene of epithelial marker KRT8) further support an epithelial stem cell identity. 2. **No Evidence of Mixed Cell Types:** - The marker list does not contain conflicting markers (e.g., **FABP2, CHGA, MUC2**) that would suggest contamination by differentiated enterocytes or secretory cells. - Pseudogenes (e.g., **RPL7P54, EIF5AP4**) are common in highly proliferative cells but do not contradict the stem cell identity. 3. **Biological Plausibility:** - The combination of **LGR5+ ASCL2+ TDGF1+** is well-documented in intestinal stem cell biology. - The absence of differentiation markers reinforces the undifferentiated, stem-like state. #### **Minor Considerations:** - Some pseudogenes (e.g., **RPL7P54, RPL41P1**) are highly ranked but are not cell-type-specific. While they do not invalidate the annotation, they may reflect transcriptional noise typical of proliferating cells. - If additional validation is desired, checking for **OLFM4** (another ISC marker) or functional assays (e.g., Wnt activity) could strengthen confidence. **Conclusion:** The annotation is **well-supported** by the provided markers and biological context.

Final Decision** - The **glial markers are dominant**, so the **EGC annotation is plausible**. - However, the **strong neuronal signal suggests this cluster may contain both glia and neurons**. ### **Validation Result: VALIDATION PASSED (with recommendation)** **Feedback:** - The annotation **'Enteric Glial Cells (EGCs)'** is supported by key glial markers (SOX10, PLP1, PTPRZ1, GFRA2, ATP1A2). - However, the presence of **multiple high-ranking neuronal markers (L1CAM, NRXN1, TUBB2B, CADM2, SYT10, ADARB2)** suggests a **mixed neuronal-glial population**. - **Recommendation:** - If possible, perform **subclustering** to separate glial and neuronal populations. - Alternatively, annotate as **'Enteric Nervous System (ENS) Cells'** (general term) or **'Enteric Glia with Neuronal Signature'** to reflect the mixed nature. - If no further refinement is possible, the current annotation is acceptable but should be noted as **potentially containing neuronal contamination**. *(Proceed with the annotation but document the neuronal marker presence for future reference.)* | Formatting Agent: { 'main_cell_type': 'Enteric Glial Cells (EGCs)', 'sub_cell_types': [ 'Enteric Glial Cells (EGCs)', 'Enteric Neurons', 'Neural Crest Progenitors' ], 'possible_mixed_cell_types': [ 'Enteric Neurons' ], 'num_markers': 50 }"

List the Key Functional Markers** The provided marker list is dominated by **immunoglobulin (Ig) genes** and **B-cell-related genes**, which strongly suggest a **B-cell lineage**. Here are the key functional markers grouped by their roles: - **Immunoglobulin Genes (B-cell function):** - **IGLL5** (Immunoglobulin Lambda Like Polypeptide 5): Essential for B-cell development. - **JCHAIN** (Joining Chain of Multimeric IgA and IgM): Critical for polymeric Ig secretion. - **IGLC3, IGLC2, IGKC, IGHG1, IGHA1, IGHA2, IGHM**: Light and heavy chain components of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG). - **IGLV6-57, IGLV3-1, IGLV2-11, IGKV4-1, IGKV1-5, IGKV3-20**: Variable regions of Ig light chains. - **TNFRSF17 (BCMA)**: B-cell maturation antigen, critical for plasma cell survival. - **MZB1**: Chaperone for IgM secretion in plasma cells. - **FCRL5 (Fc Receptor-Like 5)**: Expressed in memory B cells and plasma cells. - **Other Immune-Related Genes:** - **CCL3**: Chemokine involved in immune cell recruitment. - **LILRB4**: Immune checkpoint molecule. - **CCR10**: Chemokine receptor associated with mucosal homing. - **Miscellaneous Genes (less informative for cell typing):** - **FAM92B, MYL2, AMPD1, DERL3, BMP6, GPRC5D, DNAAF1, BFSP2, APOBEC3A**: These are either low-specificity or not directly relevant to B-cell identity. #### **2. List the Key Cell Type Markers** The most informative markers for cell typing are those associated with **B-cell subsets**, particularly **plasma cells** and **memory B cells**: - **Plasma Cell Markers:** - **JCHAIN, MZB1, TNFRSF17 (BCMA), DERL3, IGHA1, IGHA2, IGHG1, IGHM** - **XBP1 (not listed but typically co-expressed with JCHAIN and MZB1)** - **Memory B-cell Markers:** - **FCRL5, CCR10, IGKC, IGKV family genes** - **Early B-cell Markers (absent here, ruling out progenitors):** - **CD19, CD20 (MS4A1), PAX5 (not present in this list)** #### **3. Cross-reference Known Databases** - **Human Cell Atlas (HCA), Azimuth, CellMarker, PanglaoDB** confirm that: - **IGLL5, JCHAIN, MZB1, TNFRSF17, IGLC/IGKC/IGHA/IGHG** are **plasma cell markers**. - **FCRL5, CCR10** are associated with **memory B cells** but are also expressed in some plasma cells. - **DERL3** is a **highly specific plasma cell marker** (especially for secretory plasma cells). #### **4. Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type** The **overwhelming dominance of Ig genes (IGLL5, JCHAIN, IGLC, IGKC, IGHG, IGHA, IGHM) and plasma cell markers (MZB1, TNFRSF17, DERL3)** strongly indicates that this cluster is **plasma cells**. #### **5. Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types** Given the **large intestine tissue context**, the most likely **plasma cell subtypes** are: 1. **IgA+ Plasma Cells (Most Likely)** - **Supporting Markers:** **IGHA1, IGHA2, JCHAIN, CCR10 (mucosal homing)** - **Rationale:** Dominant in mucosal tissues (intestine), secrete polymeric IgA. 2. **IgG+ Plasma Cells** - **Supporting Markers:** **IGHG1, IGHG3, FCRL5** - **Rationale:** Present in gut but less abundant than IgA+ plasma cells. 3. **IgM+ Plasma Cells** - **Supporting Markers:** **IGHM, MZB1** - **Rationale:** Early plasma cells, but less likely in a mature mucosal environment. #### **6. Concise Summary of Analysis** - **General Cell Type:** **Plasma Cells** (due to high Ig and secretory markers). - **Most Likely Subtype:** **IgA+ Plasma Cells** (dominant in gut, express IGHA1/2, JCHAIN, CCR10). - **Alternative Subtypes:** IgG+ or IgM+ plasma cells (less likely due to mucosal context). **FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED: IgA-Secreting Plasma Cells (Mucosal Plasma Cells).** Would you like additional validation using a specific database (e.g., CellTypist, ImmGen)? | Coupling Validator: Validation result: VALIDATION PASSED ### **Feedback & Justification:** 1. **Marker Consistency:** - The proposed annotation (**IgA-Secreting Plasma Cells**) is strongly supported by the marker list. - **Key plasma cell markers (IGLL5, JCHAIN, MZB1, TNFRSF17, DERL3, IGHA1/2, IGHG1, IGHM)** are present and rank highly. - **Mucosal homing markers (CCR10)** further support the IgA+ plasma cell identity. 2. **No Evidence of Mixed Populations:** - While some **memory B-cell markers (FCRL5, IGKV genes)** are present, they are also expressed in plasma cells (e.g., FCRL5 in long-lived plasma cells). - No contradictory markers (e.g., **CD19, MS4A1, PAX5**) are present, ruling out contaminating naive/memory B cells. 3. **Tissue Context Alignment:** - The dominance of **IGHA1/2** and **CCR10** fits the **mucosal plasma cell** profile (expected in the intestine). ### **Minor Considerations:** - **IGM+ Plasma Cells (IGHM, MZB1)** are detectable but likely a minor subset. - **FCRL5** could indicate a **mature/long-lived plasma cell** phenotype, but this does not conflict with the IgA+ annotation. ### **Final Verdict:** The annotation is **biologically sound** and aligns with the marker profile. No revision is needed. **Optional Next Steps (if desired):** - Cross-check with **CellTypist/ImmGen** for further subtype refinement (e.g., IgA1 vs. IgA2 plasma cells). - Confirm **XBP1** (a plasma cell marker) in future analyses if available. **Output:** ``` Validation result: VALIDATION PASSED ``` | Formatting Agent: { 'main_cell_type': 'Plasma Cells', 'sub_cell_types': [ 'IgA+ Plasma Cells', 'IgG+ Plasma Cells', 'IgM+ Plasma Cells' ], 'possible_mixed_cell_types': [], 'num_markers': 50 }"

List the Key Functional Markers** The provided markers are overwhelmingly associated with **cell cycle progression, mitosis, and chromosomal segregation**. Key functional groups include: - **Mitotic spindle assembly & chromosome segregation**: - *HJURP* (centromere assembly), *CENPA* (centromere protein), *KIF2C/KIF15/KIF18B* (kinesins for spindle dynamics), *NUF2/SKA1/SKA3* (kinetochore components). - **Cell cycle regulation & proliferation**: - *AURKB*, *PLK1*, *CDK1*, *CCNB2*, *CCNA2* (cyclins/CDKs), *TOP2A* (DNA topoisomerase), *MKI67* (proliferation marker). - **DNA replication & repair**: - *CDC45*, *DTL*, *RAD51AP1*, *POLQ* (replication/repair machinery). - **Cytokinesis & cell division**: - *CEP55*, *PKMYT1*, *DIAPH3*, *BIRC5* (survivin, inhibits apoptosis during mitosis). **Conclusion**: This cluster is highly enriched in genes driving **active cell division**, suggesting a proliferating population. --- #### **2. List the Key Cell Type Markers** While most markers are cell-cycle-related, some tissue-specific context can be inferred: - *FOXM1*: Overexpressed in proliferating epithelial cells (e.g., intestinal crypt stem/progenitor cells). - *DLGAP5*: Associated with intestinal stem cells and transient amplifying cells. - *TTK*, *PBK*: Linked to epithelial proliferation in colorectal cancer and crypt regeneration. **Absence of mature epithelial markers** (e.g., *MUC2* for goblet cells, *CHGA* for enteroendocrine cells) suggests this is **not a differentiated cell type**. --- #### **3. Cross-reference Known Databases** - **Human Cell Atlas (HCA)**: Proliferating epithelial cells in the intestine express *MKI67*, *TOP2A*, and *FOXM1*. - **Single-cell studies of intestinal crypts**: - *HJURP*, *UBE2C*, *AURKB* mark **transit-amplifying (TA) cells** and **LGR5+ stem cells** in crypts. - *KIF* family genes are elevated in cycling epithelial precursors. - **Cancer contexts**: Many markers (e.g., *BIRC5*, *CEP55*) are also upregulated in colorectal cancer, but this dataset is likely non-malignant given tissue origin. --- #### **4. Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type** The cluster represents **proliferating epithelial cells** of the intestinal crypt, likely: - **Transit-amplifying (TA) cells** (primary candidate). - **Crypt base columnar (CBC) stem cells** (secondary, if *LGR5* were present but it’s not listed). --- #### **5. Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types** Ranked by likelihood: 1. **Transit-amplifying (TA) cells** - *FOXM1*, *MKI67*, *TOP2A*, *CDK1* are hallmark TA markers. - High mitotic activity matches TA’s role in rapid division before differentiation. 2. **Crypt stem cells (LGR5+)** - Less likely due to absence of *LGR5*, *ASCL2*, but *DLGAP5* and *HJURP* are stem-associated. 3. **Early progenitor cells** (pre-TA state) - Possible if cluster captures cells before full TA commitment. **Most likely subtype**: **TA cells** (dominant proliferative signature without stemness markers). --- #### **6. Concise Summary** - **Functional markers**: Overwhelmingly cell-cycle-related (mitosis, spindle assembly, DNA repair). - **Cell type markers**: Proliferating intestinal epithelial (*FOXM1+, MKI67+*), lacking differentiation markers. - **Database alignment**: Matches TA cells in intestinal crypts (HCA, literature). - **Final annotation**: **Transit-amplifying (TA) cells** of the intestinal crypt. **FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED**. | Coupling Validator: Validation result: VALIDATION PASSED ### Feedback: 1. **Marker Consistency**: - The proposed annotation (**Transit-amplifying (TA) cells**) is strongly supported by the provided marker list. Key markers like *FOXM1*, *MKI67*, *TOP2A*, *CDK1*, *AURKB*, and *BIRC5* are all present and highly ranked, aligning with proliferating epithelial cells in intestinal crypts. - The absence of differentiation markers (e.g., *MUC2*, *CHGA*) and stemness markers (e.g., *LGR5*) further reinforces this conclusion. 2. **Functional Relevance**: - The markers overwhelmingly relate to cell cycle, mitosis, and chromosomal segregation (e.g., *HJURP*, *CENPA*, *KIF2C*, *PLK1*), which is consistent with the TA cell phenotype (rapidly dividing precursors). - Tissue-specific context (e.g., *FOXM1*, *DLGAP5* in intestinal crypts) is also corroborated by literature. 3. **Database Alignment**: - The annotation matches references from the Human Cell Atlas and single-cell studies of intestinal crypts, where *MKI67+*, *TOP2A+*, and *FOXM1+* cells are identified as TA cells. 4. **Mixed Population Check**: - No evidence of mixed cell types; all markers point to a homogeneous proliferating population. The absence of conflicting markers (e.g., immune/stromal genes) supports this. **No revisions needed**. The annotation is biologically sound and well-supported by the data. | Formatting Agent: { 'main_cell_type': 'Transit-amplifying (TA) cells', 'sub_cell_types': [ 'Transit-amplifying (TA) cells', 'Crypt stem cells (LGR5+)', 'Early progenitor cells (pre-TA state)' ], 'possible_mixed_cell_types': [], 'num_markers': 50 }"
