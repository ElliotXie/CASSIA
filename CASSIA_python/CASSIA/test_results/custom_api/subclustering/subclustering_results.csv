1,Memory CD8+ T cells,Tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells (TRM),"IL7R, CD8A, CD8B, CCL4, KLRB1, ITK","The presence of IL7R, CD8A, and CD8B suggests a CD8+ T cell identity. CCL4 is associated with cytotoxic function, while KLRB1 (CD161) and ITK indicate a memory-like or tissue-resident phenotype. The combination of these markers points towards a memory or tissue-resident CD8+ T cell subset."
2,Exhausted CD8+ T cells,Terminally differentiated effector CD8+ T cells,"LAYN, HAVCR2 (TIM-3), TIGIT, IKZF2, KLRC2, KLRC3",LAYN (Layilin) and HAVCR2 (TIM-3) are markers of exhausted or chronically stimulated CD8+ T cells. TIGIT and IKZF2 are also associated with exhaustion. KLRC2 and KLRC3 (NKG2C) suggest NK-like or cytotoxic activity. This cluster likely represents exhausted or terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells with residual cytotoxic potential.
3,Effector CD8+ T cells,Effector memory CD8+ T cells,"GZMK, GZMH, NKG7, PRF1, CCL3, CCR7","GZMK, GZMH, NKG7, and PRF1 are markers of cytotoxic activity. CCR7 and HLA-DRA suggest a potential transitional state between effector and memory phenotypes. This cluster likely represents effector CD8+ T cells with cytotoxic function and some memory-like features."
4,Aberrant or rare CD8+ T cell subset,"Contaminating non-T cell (e.g., epithelial or stromal cell)","CDX2, HOXD13, PPARG, HOXB13, MECOM, RARRES1","CDX2, HOXD13, and HOXB13 are transcription factors associated with developmental processes and are not typical for CD8+ T cells. PPARG and RARRES1 suggest metabolic or regulatory functions. This cluster may represent a rare or aberrant CD8+ T cell subset with developmental or regulatory features, or possibly contamination from another cell type."
5,NK-like CD8+ T cells,Activated CD8+ T cells,"KLRF1, GNLY, CD38, FCER1G, TYROBP, FGR","KLRF1 and GNLY are markers of NK cells or NK-like CD8+ T cells. CD38, FCER1G, and TYROBP suggest activation or myeloid-like features. This cluster likely represents NK-like or activated CD8+ T cells with cytotoxic potential."
6,Contaminating mesenchymal cells,Contaminating progenitor cells,"LPL, SNAI2, HAND2, SOX2, NES, PDGFRA","LPL and SNAI2 are associated with adipogenesis or epithelial-mesenchymal transition. HAND2, SOX2, and NES are developmental transcription factors. PDGFRA is a marker of mesenchymal cells. This cluster is unlikely to be a CD8+ T cell subset and may represent contamination from mesenchymal or progenitor cells."
