Prior annotation results：
 Here is a summary of the prior cell type annotation analysis:

**Previously Identified Cell Type:** Enteric Glial Cells

**Key Supporting Markers:**
The identification was primarily supported by the strong expression of:
*   **PLP1:** A major component of myelin, highly indicative of glial cells, particularly myelinating types.
*   **SOX10:** A crucial transcription factor for neural crest-derived cells, including Schwann cells and glial cells.
*   **L1CAM:** Involved in cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth, expressed in neural cells.
*   **NRXN1/NRXN3:** Presynaptic cell adhesion molecules, indicating interaction with neurons.
*   **SOX2 & FOXD3:** Associated with neural stem cells, glial progenitors, and neural crest development.
*   **PTPRZ1:** Expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in glial cells.

**Alternative Hypotheses:**
No explicit alternative general cell types were strongly considered due to the overwhelming glial marker profile. However, within the glial category, the analysis considered:
*   General/Supportive Enteric Glial Cells
*   Myelinating Enteric Glial Cells
*   Enteric Glial Progenitors/Immature Glia

**Remaining Uncertainties:**
The analysis noted that while PLP1 suggests myelinating characteristics, myelination in the ENS is less extensive than in the CNS. The exact proportion of myelinating vs. non-myelinating or progenitor glia within the cluster was not definitively quantified. The functional markers like SPP1 and LPL were noted as consistent with the intestinal environment and potential glial functions but not exclusively glial, leaving some ambiguity regarding their specific role in this glial population.

What you should do:

1. Brief Evaluation – One concise paragraph that:

    - Highlights strengths, ambiguities, or contradictions in the current call.

    - Notes if a mixed population, doublets, or transitional state might explain the data.

2. Design up to 3 follow‑up checks (cell types or biological hypotheses):

    - When listing genes for follow-up checks, use the <check_genes>...</check_genes> tags.
    - **CRITICAL FORMATTING FOR <check_genes>:**
        - Inside the tags, provide *ONLY* a comma-separated list of official HGNC gene symbols.
        - Example: `<check_genes>GENE1,GENE2,GENE3</check_genes>` (no extra spaces, no newlines within the list, no numbering or commentary *inside* the tags).
        - Strict adherence to this format is ESSENTIAL for the analysis to proceed.
    - Include both positive and negative markers if that will clarify the call.

    - Including reasoning: why these genes, and what pattern would confirm or refute the hypothesis.

3. Upon receiving gene expression results, based on the current hypothesis, further your analysis, genearte new hypothesis to validate if you think necessary. Continue Step 2 iteratively until the cluster is confidently annotated. Once finalized, output the single line:
"FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED"
Then provide a conclusion paragraph that includes:

1.The final cell type
2.Confidence level (high, medium, or low)
3.Key markers supporting your conclusion
4.Alternative possibilities only if the confidence is not high, and what should the user do next.

## ASSISTANT

Evaluation
The current annotation for Enteric Glial Cells is largely supported by a strong set of neural crest and glial markers, particularly PLP1, SOX10, and PTPRZ1. However, the presence of markers like SPP1 and LPL, which are not exclusively glial, and the noted ambiguity regarding the extent of myelination in the ENS, introduce some uncertainty. The cluster might represent a mixed population of glial subtypes (e.g., myelinating vs. non-myelinating, or mature vs. progenitor) rather than a homogenous group, or perhaps glia interacting with other cell types, given the presence of L1CAM and NRXN1/NRXN3. The high expression of NKAIN3, a relatively less characterized gene in the context of glial cells, also warrants further investigation.

celltype to check 1

<check_genes>GFAP,S100B,CD34,CD45</check_genes>

<reasoning>
To further confirm the glial identity and rule out hematopoietic or endothelial contamination, we should check for canonical glial markers like GFAP and S100B. GFAP is a widely accepted marker for astrocytes and enteric glia, while S100B is also highly expressed in glial cells. Conversely, checking for the absence of pan-hematopoietic marker CD45 and endothelial marker CD34 would help confirm the purity of the glial population and rule out significant contamination or doublets with these cell types, which are common in intestinal tissue. High expression of GFAP and S100B, coupled with low or absent expression of CD34 and CD45, would strengthen the enteric glial cell annotation.
</reasoning>

celltype to check 2

<check_genes>MPZ,MBP,ERBB3,NGFR</check_genes>

<reasoning>
Given the uncertainty regarding myelinating vs. non-myelinating glia, we should investigate markers more specific to these subtypes. PLP1 is present, but its role in ENS myelination is less clear than in CNS. Myelin Protein Zero (MPZ) and Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) are more definitive markers of myelinating Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, and their presence would strongly support a myelinating glial subtype. Conversely, ERBB3 and NGFR (p75NTR) are expressed in immature Schwann cells and non-myelinating glia. High expression of MPZ and MBP would suggest a significant myelinating component, while high ERBB3 and NGFR would point towards a more immature or non-myelinating glial population.
</reasoning>

hypothesis to check 3

<check_genes>SOX9,NES,PROM1,CD133</check_genes>

<reasoning>
The presence of SOX2 and FOXD3 suggests a potential progenitor or stem cell component within this cluster. To further explore the possibility of enteric glial progenitors or neural stem cells, we should check for additional markers associated with these populations. SOX9 is a key transcription factor in glial development and can mark progenitors. Nestin (NES) is an intermediate filament protein expressed in neural stem cells and progenitors. PROM1 (CD133) is a common stem cell marker. High expression of these markers would support the hypothesis that a significant fraction of this cluster represents glial progenitors or immature glial cells, rather than solely mature glia.

================================================================================

## ASSISTANT

Evaluation
The new data strongly reinforces the glial identity of the cluster, with very high expression of S100B. The high expression of MPZ, ERBB3, NES, and NGFR, coupled with low MBP, PROM1, and SOX9, suggests a complex glial population. Specifically, the high MPZ points towards a myelinating or myelin-associated phenotype, while the co-expression of ERBB3, NES, and NGFR indicates the presence of immature or non-myelinating glial components, or perhaps a state of plasticity. The low expression of SOX9 and PROM1, despite the presence of NES, suggests that while some progenitor characteristics might be present, it's not a dominant feature of a broad, undifferentiated stem cell population. The absence of CD133, CD34, CD45, and GFAP from the differential expression list is noted, and their expression levels are crucial for a complete picture.

celltype to check 1

<check_genes>GFAP,CD34,CD45</check_genes>

<reasoning>
The previous check for GFAP, CD34, and CD45 was not fully resolved as they were not in the differential expression list. It is critical to confirm the expression levels of these genes. High expression of GFAP would further solidify the mature glial identity, as it is a canonical marker for enteric glia. Conversely, confirming the absence or very low expression of CD34 (endothelial marker) and CD45 (pan-hematopoietic marker) is essential to rule out contamination or doublets with non-glial cell types, which is a fundamental step in cell type annotation.
</reasoning>

celltype to check 2

<check_genes>KROX20,SOX10,FOXD3,PLP1</check_genes>

<reasoning>
Given the high expression of MPZ and the low expression of MBP, we need to further dissect the myelinating characteristics. KROX20 (EGR2) is a key transcription factor essential for Schwann cell myelination. Its high expression would strongly support a myelinating Schwann cell-like phenotype within the enteric glia. We should also re-evaluate the expression of SOX10, FOXD3, and PLP1, which were initially identified as key supporting markers. Confirming their continued high expression alongside MPZ and KROX20 would help to define the specific subtype of enteric glia, potentially indicating a population with myelin-forming capabilities or a state of active myelination.
</reasoning>

hypothesis to check 3

<check_genes>CDH19,L1CAM,NRXN1,NRXN3,SPP1,LPL,NKAIN3</check_genes>

<reasoning>
The initial annotation highlighted several markers (CDH19, L1CAM, NRXN1, NRXN3, SPP1, LPL, NKAIN3) that were noted as consistent with glial functions but not exclusively glial. Given the current data suggesting a mixed glial population (myelinating/immature/non-myelinating), it's important to understand the specific contribution of these genes. High expression of CDH19 and L1CAM could indicate specific cell adhesion properties or interactions. NRXN1/NRXN3 suggest close association or interaction with neurons. SPP1 and LPL might point towards specific metabolic or immune-modulatory roles of these glia in the intestinal environment. NKAIN3 remains an interesting, less characterized marker. Understanding their co-expression patterns with the more definitive glial and myelin markers will help refine the functional state and specific subtype composition of this cluster.

================================================================================

## ASSISTANT

Evaluation
The new data strongly confirms the initial glial and neural crest origin, with very high and widespread expression of PLP1, SOX10, L1CAM, NRXN1, NRXN3, and FOXD3. The high expression of CDH19, SPP1, LPL, and NKAIN3, which were previously noted as less specific, now appear to be highly expressed across a large proportion of the cells within the cluster, suggesting they are integral to the phenotype of this specific glial population. The continued absence of CD34, CD45, GFAP, and KROX20 from the differential expression list is still a critical missing piece of information, as their expression levels are crucial for definitive conclusions regarding contamination, overall glial maturity, and specific myelinating characteristics.

celltype to check 1

<check_genes>GFAP,CD34,CD45</check_genes>

<reasoning>
It is imperative to obtain expression data for GFAP, CD34, and CD45. The absence of these genes from the differential expression list does not mean they are not expressed, but rather that their expression might not be significantly different from other clusters or that they were not included in the initial differential analysis. High expression of GFAP would provide strong evidence for mature enteric glia. Conversely, confirming the absence or very low expression of CD34 and CD45 is fundamental to rule out contamination or doublets with endothelial or hematopoietic cells, which is a prerequisite for a confident cell type annotation.
</reasoning>

celltype to check 2

<check_genes>KROX20,MBP,PMP22,SNAI2</check_genes>

<reasoning>
Given the high expression of PLP1 and MPZ (from previous data), and the continued absence of MBP, we need to further clarify the myelinating status. KROX20 (EGR2) is a crucial transcription factor for Schwann cell myelination, and its expression level is key to understanding the extent of myelinating glia. PMP22 is another important component of peripheral myelin. If KROX20 and PMP22 are highly expressed, it would strongly suggest a significant myelinating component, even if MBP is low. Additionally, SNAI2 (Slug) is a marker for neural crest cells and can be involved in Schwann cell development; its expression could provide further insight into the developmental stage or plasticity of these cells.
</reasoning>

hypothesis to check 3

<check_genes>APOE,CLU,CST3,AQP4</check_genes>

<reasoning>
The high expression of LPL and SPP1, while not exclusively glial, can be associated with lipid metabolism and extracellular matrix remodeling, functions often attributed to glia in various contexts, including injury or disease. To explore potential functional states or subtypes beyond just myelinating/non-myelinating, we should investigate markers related to glial metabolic support or reactive states. APOE and CLU (Clusterin) are involved in lipid transport and clearance, and are expressed by glia. CST3 (Cystatin C) is a protease inhibitor expressed by glia. AQP4 is an aquaporin expressed by astrocytes and some glia, involved in water homeostasis. High expression of these markers could indicate specific metabolic or supportive roles of this enteric glial population within the intestinal microenvironment.

================================================================================

## ASSISTANT

Evaluation
The data continues to strongly support a glial identity, with the high expression of CLU, CST3, and APOE suggesting significant metabolic and supportive roles, potentially indicating a reactive or highly active state. The very high expression of PMP22, coupled with the previously observed high MPZ and PLP1, further strengthens the presence of a myelinating or myelin-associated glial population, despite the persistent low expression of MBP. The continued absence of GFAP, KROX20, CD34, and CD45 from the differential expression list remains a critical gap, preventing a definitive assessment of overall glial maturity, specific myelinating commitment, and purity from non-glial contaminants.

celltype to check 1

<check_genes>GFAP,CD34,CD45</check_genes>

<reasoning>
It is absolutely essential to obtain expression data for GFAP, CD34, and CD45. Without this information, we cannot definitively confirm the overall maturity of the glial population (GFAP) or rule out contamination from common non-glial cell types (CD34, CD45). These are fundamental checks for any cell type annotation and their continued absence from the differential expression list is a significant impediment to a confident conclusion.
</reasoning>

celltype to check 2

<check_genes>KROX20,SOX9,SOX2</check_genes>

<reasoning>
Given the strong evidence for myelin-associated glia (PLP1, MPZ, PMP22) but low MBP, and the previous observation of high ERBB3, NES, and NGFR (suggesting immature/non-myelinating components), we need to clarify the specific commitment to myelination and the developmental stage. KROX20 (EGR2) is a key transcription factor for myelinating Schwann cells; its expression level is crucial to confirm the myelinating phenotype. Re-evaluating SOX9 and SOX2, which are involved in glial development and progenitor states, will help determine if there's a significant population of less differentiated or progenitor glia contributing to the observed heterogeneity. High KROX20 would solidify the myelinating aspect, while high SOX9/SOX2 would point to a more progenitor-like state.
</reasoning>

hypothesis to check 3

<check_genes>S100B,PTPRZ1,CHL1,CADM2</check_genes>

<reasoning>
The cluster shows high expression of many general glial and neural adhesion markers. To further refine the specific subtype of enteric glia, we should examine a broader panel of established enteric glial markers. S100B and PTPRZ1 were previously identified as supporting markers and their continued high expression would reinforce the general glial identity. CHL1 (Cell Adhesion Molecule L1-like) and CADM2 (Cell Adhesion Molecule 2) are also known to be expressed in neural and glial cells and can help characterize the specific adhesion and interaction properties of this enteric glial population. Consistent high expression of these markers would strengthen the overall enteric glial annotation and provide more granular detail on their adhesive profile.

The data continues to strongly support a glial identity, with very high and widespread expression of S100B, PTPRZ1, CHL1, and CADM2, reinforcing the general glial and neural adhesion characteristics. The high expression of SOX2, coupled with the previously observed high NES and NGFR, suggests a significant proportion of immature or progenitor-like glia, or glia with developmental plasticity. The persistent low expression of SOX9 is notable, as it is a key glial transcription factor, and its low level might indicate a specific subtype or developmental stage. The continued absence of GFAP, KROX20, CD34, and CD45 from the differential expression list remains a critical impediment to a definitive and confident annotation, as these markers are crucial for assessing overall glial maturity, specific myelinating commitment, and ruling out contamination.

It is absolutely paramount to obtain expression data for GFAP, CD34, and CD45. The repeated absence of these genes from the differential expression list is a major limitation. GFAP is a canonical marker for mature enteric glia, and its expression level is crucial for confirming the maturity of this population. Similarly, confirming the absence or very low expression of CD34 (endothelial) and CD45 (hematopoietic) is fundamental to ensure the purity of the cluster and rule out contamination or doublets, which is a prerequisite for a confident annotation. Without this data, the annotation remains incomplete and potentially compromised.

Despite strong evidence for myelin-associated glia (high PLP1, MPZ, PMP22), the low MBP and the continued absence of KROX20 data leave ambiguity regarding the extent and nature of myelination. KROX20 (EGR2) is a critical transcription factor for myelinating Schwann cells; its expression level is essential to confirm the commitment to myelination. Re-examining MBP, MPZ, and PMP22 together will provide a comprehensive picture of the myelin-related gene expression profile. High KROX20, along with high MPZ and PMP22, would strongly indicate a myelinating phenotype, even if MBP remains low, suggesting a specific type of myelin or a different stage of myelination.

The high expression of SOX2, NES, and NGFR, coupled with low SOX9, suggests a population with progenitor characteristics or developmental plasticity. To further explore this, we should investigate SNAI2 (Slug), a neural crest and Schwann cell progenitor marker. Re-examining FOXD3 and SOX10, which are key neural crest and glial development transcription factors, will help to understand the developmental origin and potential for differentiation within this cluster. ERBB3, a receptor for neuregulins, is crucial for Schwann cell development and survival, and its expression can indicate a proliferative or immature state. High expression of these markers would support the presence of a significant proportion of enteric glial progenitors or immature glia with ongoing developmental programs.

Evaluation
The data consistently and strongly supports an enteric glial cell identity, characterized by high expression of canonical glial markers (S100B, PTPRZ1), neural crest derivatives (SOX10, FOXD3), and cell adhesion molecules (L1CAM, NRXN1/3, CDH19, CHL1, CADM2). The presence of high PLP1, MPZ, and PMP22, despite low MBP, indicates a significant myelin-associated or myelinating component, possibly representing a specific type of enteric myelin or a stage of myelination. The co-expression of ERBB3, NES, NGFR, and SOX2 suggests a degree of immaturity, plasticity, or progenitor characteristics within the population. The high expression of LPL, SPP1, APOE, CLU, and CST3 points towards active metabolic and supportive roles. The persistent absence of GFAP, KROX20, CD34, and CD45 from the differential expression list remains the primary limitation, preventing a definitive assessment of overall glial maturity, specific myelinating commitment, and the absolute purity of the cluster from non-glial contaminants.

FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED
Conclusion:
The final cell type is **Enteric Glial Cells, with a significant myelin-associated and immature/progenitor component.**

Confidence level: **Medium-High**

Key markers supporting your conclusion:
*   **General Glial Identity:** S100B, PTPRZ1, L1CAM, NRXN1, NRXN3, CDH19, CHL1, CADM2.
*   **Neural Crest/Developmental:** SOX10, FOXD3, SOX2, NES, NGFR.
*   **Myelin-Associated/Myelinating:** PLP1, MPZ, PMP22.
*   **Metabolic/Supportive/Reactive:** LPL, SPP1, APOE, CLU, CST3.
*   **Immature/Plasticity:** ERBB3.

Alternative possibilities:
While the evidence strongly points to enteric glia, the confidence is not "High" due to the persistent lack of data for critical markers. The primary alternative possibilities, or rather, unresolved nuances within the glial annotation, are:
1.  **Mixed Glial Subtypes:** The cluster likely represents a heterogeneous population comprising both myelin-associated/myelinating glia and immature/progenitor glia, rather than a single homogenous subtype.
2.  **Specific Myelinating Glia:** The low MBP despite high PLP1, MPZ, and PMP22 suggests a specific type of enteric myelinating glia that differs from canonical CNS/PNS myelinating cells, or a specific stage of myelination.
3.  **Contamination/Doublets:** The absence of CD34 and CD45 data means we cannot definitively rule out minor contamination from endothelial or hematopoietic cells, although the overall marker profile strongly argues against significant contamination.
4.  **Overall Glial Maturity:** The lack of GFAP data prevents a definitive assessment of the overall maturity of the enteric glial population.

What should the user do next:
The user should prioritize obtaining expression data for **GFAP, KROX20, CD34, and CD45**.
*   **GFAP:** To confirm the maturity and overall glial identity. High GFAP would increase confidence in mature enteric glia.
*   **KROX20:** To definitively assess the commitment to myelination. High KROX20 would strongly support a myelinating phenotype.
*   **CD34 and CD45:** To confirm the purity of the cluster and rule out contamination from non-glial cell types. Very low or absent expression would increase confidence in the purity of the glial population.
Further sub-clustering of this population based on the expression patterns of myelin-associated (PLP1, MPZ, PMP22, KROX20) versus immature/progenitor (SOX2, NES, NGFR, ERBB3) markers could help delineate distinct glial subtypes within this cluster.
