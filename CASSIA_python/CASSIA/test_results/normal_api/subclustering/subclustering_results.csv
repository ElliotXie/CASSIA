1,Naive/Early Memory CD8+ T cells,Central Memory CD8+ T cells,"IL7R, KLRB1, CD2, CD6, ANXA1, ITK, FYB1, CD48, CD8A, CD8B","This cluster shows high expression of IL7R (CD127), a receptor crucial for T cell survival and memory development. KLRB1 (CD161) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed on NK cells and a subset of T cells, often associated with tissue-resident memory T cells or innate-like T cells. CD2 and CD6 are general T cell markers. ANXA1 is involved in immune regulation. ITK is a T cell-specific kinase. FYB1 (SLP-76) is a key adaptor protein in TCR signaling. CD48 is a costimulatory molecule. The presence of CD8A and CD8B confirms their CD8 T cell lineage. The overall profile suggests a relatively quiescent or early memory phenotype, potentially poised for activation."
2,Exhausted CD8+ T cells,"Innate-like CD8+ T cells (e.g., MAIT-like or NKT-like CD8s)","KLRC3, KLRC2, HAVCR2, TIGIT, TNFRSF9, ENTPD1, SIRPG, TRDC, TRGV4","This cluster is characterized by the expression of multiple NK cell receptors (KLRC3, KLRC2, which are NKG2E and NKG2C respectively), as well as immune checkpoints like HAVCR2 (TIM-3) and TIGIT, indicating an exhausted or terminally differentiated phenotype. TNFRSF9 (CD137) is an activation marker. ENTPD1 (CD39) is often co-expressed with TIM-3 and TIGIT on exhausted T cells, involved in ATP hydrolysis. SIRPG is an inhibitory receptor. The presence of TRDC and TRGV4 suggests a potential gamma-delta T cell component or a subset of CD8 T cells with innate-like features, although these are typically distinct lineages. Given the context of being a CD8 T cell subcluster, it points towards a highly activated, potentially exhausted, or innate-like CD8 T cell subset."
3,Effector Memory CD8+ T cells (TEMRA-like),Activated Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells,"GZMK, KLRG1, EOMES, GZMH, VCAM1, CCR7, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, NKG7, PRF1, CD28, CD27, CST7","This cluster exhibits a strong cytotoxic signature with high expression of GZMK, GZMH, NKG7, and PRF1 (Perforin), indicating effector function. KLRG1 is a marker of terminal differentiation and senescence in T cells. EOMES is a transcription factor crucial for effector and memory CD8 T cell differentiation. The co-expression of CCR7 and HLA-DR (MHC Class II) is interesting; CCR7 is typically associated with central memory or naive cells, while HLA-DR is an activation marker often seen on highly activated or exhausted T cells. VCAM1 can be expressed on activated T cells. CD28 and CD27 are costimulatory molecules, with CD27 being a marker of memory T cells. The combination suggests a highly active, terminally differentiated effector memory phenotype, potentially with some features of exhaustion or recent activation."
4,Contaminating Epithelial/Stromal Cells (if not true T cells),Highly Aberrant/Dysregulated CD8+ T cells (if true T cells),"CDX2, HOXD13, PLSCR4, CEACAM7, IGF2BP2, DLL4, PPARG, HOXB13, MUC4","This cluster presents a highly unusual and unexpected marker profile for T cells, with many markers typically associated with epithelial cells, developmental processes, or even cancer. CDX2, HOXD13, CEACAM7, MUC4, and DLL4 are commonly found in gut epithelial cells or involved in developmental patterning. PPARG is a nuclear receptor involved in adipogenesis and inflammation, but not typically a defining T cell marker. IGF2BP2 is an RNA-binding protein. The presence of these markers within a CD8 T cell cluster is highly atypical and could suggest several possibilities: 1) Contamination from other cell types during single-cell sequencing. 2) A very rare, highly specialized, or aberrant CD8 T cell subset with unique developmental or tissue-specific programming. 3) Technical artifact or misannotation. Without further context or validation, it's difficult to definitively assign a T cell identity. However, if forced to interpret within the CD8 T cell context, it might represent a highly unusual, potentially tissue-specific or dysregulated state."
5,NKT-like CD8+ T cells,Terminally Differentiated Effector CD8+ T cells with NK-like features,"ITGAX, TYROBP, FCER1G, KLRF1, GNLY, SH2D1B, CD38, S100A13, IL18, KIR2DL4, KLRC1, HAVCR2, TMIGD2","This cluster shows strong expression of markers associated with NK cells and innate-like lymphocytes. ITGAX (CD11c) is often found on dendritic cells but also on some activated T cells and NK cells. TYROBP (DAP12) and FCER1G (FcRÎ³) are adaptor proteins crucial for signaling in NK cells and myeloid cells. KLRF1 (NKG2D), GNLY (Granulysin), KIR2DL4, and KLRC1 (NKG2A) are classic NK cell cytotoxic and inhibitory receptors. SH2D1B (EAT-2) is involved in NK cell signaling. CD38 is an activation marker. IL18 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine. HAVCR2 (TIM-3) is an exhaustion marker. The overall profile strongly points towards an innate-like cytotoxic CD8 T cell subset, often referred to as NKT-like or MAIT-like cells, or terminally differentiated effector cells that have acquired NK cell-like features."
6,Contaminating Stromal/Mesenchymal Cells (if not true T cells),"Highly Aberrant/Dysregulated CD8+ T cells (if true T cells, but less likely)","LPL, SNAI2, HAND2, FGF2, ABCA6, L1CAM, SOX2, ANGPTL1, RBP1, SPP1, NRXN1, NES, ADGRG6, CHL1, PTPN13, CDH19, NCAM2, SPARCL1, PDGFRA, SPARC, MYOT, RASSF4, LAMA4, MAP1B, PMP22, TCF4, CADM2, NRXN3, PRIMA1, MXRA8, TNS1, TIMP3, SFRP5","Similar to cluster 4, this cluster displays a highly unusual marker profile for T cells, with many genes typically associated with mesenchymal cells, neural development, or stromal components. LPL (Lipoprotein Lipase), SNAI2 (Slug), HAND2, FGF2, ABCA6, L1CAM, SOX2, ANGPTL1, RBP1, SPP1 (Osteopontin), NRXN1, NES (Nestin), CHL1, PTPN13, CDH19 (Cadherin-19), NCAM2, SPARCL1, PDGFRA, SPARC, MYOT, LAMA4, MAP1B, PMP22, TCF4, CADM2, NRXN3, TIMP3, and SFRP5 are all markers commonly found in fibroblasts, neural cells, adipocytes, or involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and development. The presence of these markers within a CD8 T cell cluster is highly anomalous and strongly suggests either significant contamination from non-immune cells (e.g., stromal cells, neural cells) or a severe misclassification. If it were a true CD8 T cell subset, it would represent an extremely rare and highly specialized, perhaps transdifferentiated or dysregulated, state, which is less likely than contamination."
