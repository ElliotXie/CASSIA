The high expression of SOX10, PLP1, S100B, NGFR, CDH19, L1CAM, and MYOT are all consistent with this lineage. The persistent and high expression of MPZ, PMP22, and PRX, coupled with the absence of MBP (from previous data) and KROX20 (not in list), strongly points towards **non-myelinating Schwann cells**. The presence of neuronal-associated markers (SYP, SNAP25) with `pct.1` values less than 1.00, alongside high SPP1, SFRP5, WNT6, GFRA2, and LGR5, suggests a highly interactive, potentially reactive, or progenitor-like non-myelinating Schwann cell population. The low expression of CD44 and PROM1 argues against a broad progenitor state, but LGR5 is still high. The evidence is converging towards a specific type of non-myelinating Schwann cell.\\n\\ncelltype to check 1\\n\\n<check_genes>\\nSOX10,PLP1,S100B,MPZ,PMP22,PRX,GFAP\\n</check_genes>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nTo finalize the distinction between non-myelinating Schwann cells and EGCs, we need to confirm the absence of canonical EGC markers like GFAP. While both are neural crest-derived glia, the consistent high expression of MPZ, PMP22, and PRX, in the absence of MBP, is a hallmark of non-myelinating Schwann cells. If GFAP remains low or absent, it would strongly support non-myelinating Schwann cells over typical EGCs. SOX10, PLP1, and S100B are expressed by both, but the specific myelin-related protein signature is more definitive for non-myelinating Schwann cells.\\n</reasoning>\\n\\nhypothesis to check 2\\n\\n<check_genes>\\nSYP,SNAP25,NRXN1,NRXN3,SOX10,PLP1,MYOT\\n</check_genes>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe persistent expression of neuronal-associated markers (SYP, SNAP25, NRXN1, NRXN3) with `pct.1` values less than 1.00 suggests a subset of cells or a specific interaction. We need to determine if this represents a true mixed population (e.g., doublets of non-myelinating Schwann cells and neurons) or a highly specialized non-myelinating Schwann cell that expresses these genes due to intimate neuro-glial interactions. If the expression of these neuronal markers is restricted to a small fraction of cells, it could indicate contamination. If they are consistently co-expressed within the same cells that also express high levels of non-myelinating Schwann cell markers (SOX10, PLP1, MYOT), it would suggest a unique functional state of these Schwann cells.\\n</reasoning>\\n\\nhypothesis to check 3\\n\\n<check_genes>\\nSPP1,SFRP5,WNT6,GFRA2,LGR5,NGFR,CDH19\\n</check_genes>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe high expression of SPP1, SFRP5, WNT6, GFRA2, LGR5, NGFR, and CDH19 suggests a highly active and interactive non-myelinating Schwann cell population, potentially involved in development, regeneration, or a reactive state. SPP1 is often associated with reactive glia and cell adhesion. SFRP5 and WNT6 are involved in Wnt signaling, crucial for development and plasticity. GFRA2 and NGFR are involved in neurotrophic signaling. LGR5 indicates a potential stem/progenitor-like capacity or a specific functional subset. This check aims to characterize the functional state and potential plasticity of these non-myelinating Schwann cells.\\n</reasoning>\\nFINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED\\nThe final cell type is **Non-myelinating Schwann Cells**.\\nConfidence level: **High**.\\nKey markers supporting your conclusion: The robust and consistent expression of SOX10, PLP1, S100B, NGFR, CDH19, L1CAM, MYOT, combined with the specific myelin-related protein signature of high MPZ, PMP22, and PRX, and critically, the *absence* of MBP and GFAP (from previous checks), strongly points to non-myelinating Schwann cells. The presence of neuronal-associated markers (SYP, SNAP25, NRXN1, NRXN3) is interpreted as reflecting the intimate neuro-glial interactions characteristic of these cells in the enteric nervous system, rather than a neuronal identity or significant contamination, especially given the high expression of adhesion molecules and signaling pathway components.'}"

High-level expression of Ig genes is the defining characteristic of antibody-secreting plasma cells.\\n2.  **JCHAIN (Joining Chain):** Ranked 3rd, JCHAIN is crucial for the polymerization of IgA (to form dimers) and IgM (to form pentamers). Its high expression strongly supports the presence of plasma cells, particularly those secreting polymeric immunoglobulins.\\n3.  **TNFRSF17 (BCMA - B-Cell Maturation Antigen):** Ranked 9th, TNFRSF17 is a key survival receptor for plasma cells and is considered a canonical plasma cell marker.\\n4.  **MZB1 (Marginal Zone B And B-1 Cell Specific Protein):** Ranked 19th, MZB1 is expressed in plasma cells and plays a role in antibody secretion by regulating calcium homeostasis in the ER.\\n5.  **XBP1 (not listed, but implied):** While not explicitly listed, the high Ig production machinery markers (like DERL3, TXNDC5 involved in ER proteostasis) are consistent with high XBP1 activity, a master regulator of plasma cell differentiation and function. DERL3 is involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD), important for handling misfolded proteins during high Ig production. TXNDC5 is a PDI family member, crucial for disulfide bond formation in immunoglobulins.\\n6.  **Lack of B-cell specific markers (e.g., CD19, CD20/MS4A1, PAX5):** While this list represents positive markers, the strong plasma cell signature suggests these cells have differentiated beyond the B-cell stage where these markers would be downregulated.\\n7.  **FCRL5 (Fc Receptor Like 5):** Ranked 38th, FCRL5 can be expressed on a subset of memory B cells and plasma cells, often associated with tissue-resident plasma cells.\\n\\nThe sheer abundance and high ranking of Ig genes, JCHAIN, and TNFRSF17 unequivocally point to a plasma cell identity.\"}, 'IgA-secreting Plasma Cells': {'score': '90', 'reasoning': 'This marker set strongly supports the presence of IgA-secreting plasma cells.\\n1.  **IGHA1 and IGHA2:** These genes encode the constant regions of the IgA1 and IgA2 heavy chains, respectively.

LPL (Lipoprotein Lipase) is involved in lipid metabolism. SPARC (Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine) and PDGFRA (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha) are mesenchymal markers. LAMA4 (Laminin Subunit Alpha 4) is part of the extracellular matrix. The presence of these markers in a CD8 T cell cluster is highly atypical and suggests either a very rare, uncharacterized, or aberrantly expressed phenotype, or potential contamination from stromal/mesenchymal cells. If these are indeed CD8 T cells, they might represent a highly specialized tissue-resident population with unique developmental or metabolic adaptations, but this is speculative.', 'Most likely top2 cell types': ['Atypical/Contaminated CD8+ T cell cluster (potential misannotation or rare, uncharacterized subset)', 'CD8+ T cells with mesenchymal-like or developmental gene expression (e.g., due to specific tissue microenvironment or disease state)']}]\n",

Regulatory Status:\\n- Expression of regulatory receptors (TIGIT, LAG3)\\n- Balance of activating and inhibitory NK receptors\\n\\nAlternative Possibilities:\\nWhile confidence is high for NK cell identity, there could be some heterogeneity in the population, particularly in terms of activation states. However, the core identity as CD56bright tissue-resident NK cells is well-supported.\\n\\nClinical/Biological Relevance:\\nThese cells appear to be tissue-resident NK cells with both cytotoxic and immunomodulatory functions, typical of those found in mucosal tissues like the large intestine. Their phenotype suggests active surveillance and immune response roles in the tissue microenvironment.\\n\\nThe high confidence level is based on:\\n1. Clear NK cell marker pattern\\n2. Distinct absence of T cell markers\\n3. Coherent functional profile\\n4. Tissue-appropriate phenotype\\n5. Consistent expression patterns across multiple marker categories'}"
