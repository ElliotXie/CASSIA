1. **Result 1**: (Lymphatic Endothelial Cell, Lymphatic Endothelial Cell)
   - General cell type: Lymphatic Endothelial Cell
   - Subtype: Lymphatic Endothelial Cell

2. **Result 2**: (Lymphatic Endothelial Cell, Lymphatic Endothelial Cell)
   - General cell type: Lymphatic Endothelial Cell
   - Subtype: Lymphatic Endothelial Cell

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- Both results indicate the same general cell type: Lymphatic Endothelial Cell.
- Both results also indicate the same subtype: Lymphatic Endothelial Cell.
- There is no variation in the results, which suggests a strong consensus.

**Final determination:**

- The consensus general cell type is ""Lymphatic Endothelial Cell"".
- The consensus subtype is ""Lymphatic Endothelial Cell"".
- There is no evidence of mixed cell types since both results are identical.

**Consensus score:**

- Since both results are identical, the consensus score is 100, indicating perfect agreement.

**JSON output:**

```json

  ""final_results"": [
    ""Lymphatic Endothelial Cell"",
    ""Lymphatic Endothelial Cell""
  ],
  ""possible_mixed_celltypes"": [],
  ""consensus_score"": 100
}

This output reflects the strong agreement between the results, with no indication of mixed cell types.","To determine the consensus cell type, let's analyze the provided results:

1. **Result 1**: ('endothelial cell of lymphatic vessel', 'endothelial cell of lymphatic vessel')
   - General cell type: endothelial cell of lymphatic vessel
   - Subtype: endothelial cell of lymphatic vessel

2. **Result 2**: ('endothelial cell of lymphatic vessel', 'endothelial cell of lymphatic vessel')
   - General cell type: endothelial cell of lymphatic vessel
   - Subtype: endothelial cell of lymphatic vessel

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- Both results indicate the same general cell type: ""endothelial cell of lymphatic vessel"".
- Both results also indicate the same subtype: ""endothelial cell of lymphatic vessel"".
- There is no variation between the results, suggesting a strong consensus.

**Final determination:**

- **Final General Cell Type**: endothelial cell of lymphatic vessel
- **Final Subtype**: endothelial cell of lymphatic vessel

**Possible Mixed Cell Types:**

- There is no evidence of mixed cell types as both results are identical.

**Consensus Score:**

- Since both results are identical, the consensus score is 100, indicating perfect agreement.

1. **Result 1**: (Endothelial Cell, Venous Endothelial Cell)
   - General cell type: Endothelial Cell
   - Subtype: Venous Endothelial Cell

2. **Result 2**: (Endothelial Cell, Vascular Endothelial Cell)
   - General cell type: Endothelial Cell
   - Subtype: Vascular Endothelial Cell

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- **General Cell Type**: Both results agree on the general cell type being ""Endothelial Cell"". This is a strong consensus for the general cell type.

- **Subtype**: The subtypes differ between the two results:
  - Result 1 suggests ""Venous Endothelial Cell"".
  - Result 2 suggests ""Vascular Endothelial Cell"".

- **Mixed Cell Types**: The subtypes are both related to the vascular system, with ""Venous"" being a specific type of ""Vascular"". This suggests that there might be a mixed population or a lack of specificity in the subtype annotation.

- **Consensus Score**: Since the general cell type is consistent but the subtypes differ, the consensus score should reflect this partial agreement. A score of around 70 would indicate strong agreement on the general cell type but some disagreement on the subtype.

**Final Answer in JSON format:**

```json

This output reflects the consensus on the general cell type and acknowledges the potential for mixed subtypes. The consensus score indicates a strong agreement on the general cell type but some variability in the subtype.","To determine the consensus cell type, let's analyze the given results:

1. **Result 1**: ('endothelial cell', 'vein endothelial cell')
   - General cell type: endothelial cell

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- **General Cell Type**: Both results agree on the general cell type being ""endothelial cell"". This is a strong consensus for the general cell type.

- **Subtype**: The subtypes differ between the two results:
  - Result 1 specifies ""vein endothelial cell"".
  - Result 2 specifies ""endothelial cell of vascular tree"".

- **Possible Mixed Cell Types**: The subtypes suggest that there might be a mixture of endothelial cells from different parts of the vascular system. However, both subtypes are related to the vascular system, which is consistent with the general cell type.

- **Consensus Score**: Since the general cell type is consistent across both results, but the subtypes differ, the consensus score should reflect this partial agreement. A reasonable score would be around 70, indicating strong agreement on the general cell type but some variation in the subtype.
