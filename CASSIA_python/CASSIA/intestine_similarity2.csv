1. Looking at the general cell type:
- Both results show ""Plasma Cell""
- 100% agreement on the general cell type

2. Looking at the subtypes:
- Both results show ""IgA-secreting Plasma Cell""
- 100% agreement on the subtype

3. Analysis of consistency:
- Perfect agreement between both runs
- No evidence of mixed cell types
- Both general and subtype classifications are identical
- This suggests a very robust classification

4. Confidence assessment:
- With identical results across runs
- Clear plasma cell markers must be present
- Specific IgA markers must be consistently detected
- This indicates a very high confidence classification

1. Analyzing general cell types:
- Both results show ""Cytotoxic T Cell"" as the general cell type
- This shows 100% agreement on the general cell type

2. Analyzing subtypes:
- Result 1 shows ""Tissue-Resident Memory Cd8+ T Cell""
- Result 2 shows ""Cytotoxic T Cell""
- Both subtypes are related to cytotoxic T cell lineage, but with different specificity

3. Reasoning for final call:
- The general cell type is clearly Cytotoxic T Cell
- For the subtype, since one result is more specific (Tissue-Resident Memory CD8+ T Cell) and this is a known subtype of cytotoxic T cells, we can use this more detailed annotation
- No evidence of mixed cell types as both results point to cytotoxic T cell lineage

4. Consensus score calculation:
- General cell type agreement: 100%
- Subtype partial agreement (both in cytotoxic lineage): ~80%
- Overall consensus score: 90

3. Analysis:
- Both results are exactly the same
- Both identify the cell as an Intestinal Epithelial Cell
- Both specifically identify it as an Intestinal Stem Cell (ISC)
- There is perfect agreement between the results
- No evidence of mixed cell types
- The consistency between runs suggests high confidence in the annotation

3. Analyzing consistency:
- Both results point to the exact same cell identity
- No evidence of mixed cell types
- The annotations are extremely consistent across runs

4. Confidence assessment:
- The perfect agreement between runs
- The consistent identification of L-cell subtype
- The biological coherence (L-cells are indeed a well-known subtype of enteroendocrine cells)
