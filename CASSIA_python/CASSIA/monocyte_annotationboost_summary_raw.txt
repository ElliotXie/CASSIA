<OVERVIEW>
This report summarizes the iterative gene expression analysis performed by CASSIA to annotate a cell cluster. The analysis involved 4 iterations, examining a total of 51 unique genes.
</OVERVIEW>

<INITIAL_ASSESSMENT>
The initial hypothesis was Enteric Glial Cells, strongly supported by canonical glial markers (PLP1, SOX10, L1CAM, NRXN1, NRXN3, SOX2, FOXD3, PTPRZ1). High PLP1 suggested myelinating or myelin-like glia. Ambiguities included the presence of SPP1 and LPL, and the possibility of a mixed or transitional population.
</INITIAL_ASSESSMENT>

<ITERATION_1>
<HYPOTHESES>
1. To further confirm glial identity and explore subtypes by checking additional glial markers (GFAP, S100B, MBP, OLIG1, OLIG2, PDGFRA), expecting high GFAP, S100B, and MBP to support myelinating glia.
2. To exclude contamination from common non-glial cell types (myeloid, T-cells, epithelial, endothelial) by checking their markers (CD68, CD163, LYZ, CD3G, CD8A, CD4, EPCAM, KRT18, VWF, PECAM1), expecting low or absent expression.
3. To investigate the possibility of glial progenitors or stem-like cells given the presence of SOX2 and FOXD3, by checking progenitor/stem cell markers (SOX9, NES, PROM1, LGR5, CD44, CD24), expecting expression patterns indicative of a progenitor state.
</HYPOTHESES>

<GENES_CHECKED>
CD24, CD3G, CD44, CD8A, EPCAM, KRT18, LGR5, LYZ, MBP, NES, PROM1, S100B, SOX9
</GENES_CHECKED>

<KEY_FINDINGS>
High expression of S100B and NES strongly supported glial identity. Very high LGR5 expression was unexpected. Low expression of CD24, CD3G, CD8A, EPCAM, KRT18, MBP, PROM1, and SOX9, and absence of other non-glial markers, argued against significant contamination and suggested this was not typical myelinating glia despite initial PLP1. Moderate LYZ expression was noted as an ambiguity. Low MBP contradicted the initial myelinating hypothesis.
</KEY_FINDATION>
</ITERATION_1>

<ITERATION_2>
<HYPOTHESES>
1. To investigate the high LGR5 expression alongside other stem/progenitor markers (SOX2, NES, CD44, CD24, PROM1) and an epithelial marker (EPCAM) to determine if it indicates a glial progenitor with stem-like features, expecting high LGR5, NES, SOX2 and low CD24, PROM1, EPCAM.
2. To re-evaluate the myelinating glial hypothesis by examining PLP1, MBP, and other core glial markers (SOX10, NRXN1, NRXN3, PTPRZ1, S100B) to understand the relationship between PLP1 and MBP expression, expecting high core glial markers but needing to assess PLP1/MBP pattern.
3. To definitively rule out myeloid contamination by examining LYZ alongside more specific myeloid markers (CD68, CD163, CSF1R, PTPRC, CD14), expecting low or absent expression of additional myeloid markers.
</HYPOTHESES>

<GENES_CHECKED>
CD14, CD24, CD44, EPCAM, LGR5, LYZ, MBP, NES, NRXN1, NRXN3, PLP1, PROM1, PTPRC, PTPRZ1, S100B, SOX10, SOX2
</GENES_CHECKED>

<KEY_FINDINGS>
Glial identity was reinforced by high PLP1, NRXN1, NRXN3, PTPRZ1, S100B, SOX10, and SOX2. High LGR5 remained significant and unusual. Low MBP confirmed this was not predominantly myelinating glia. Low expression of CD24, EPCAM, PROM1, PTPRC, and absence of CD163, CD68, CSF1R ruled out significant epithelial, typical progenitor, or most myeloid contamination. High CD14 and moderate LYZ were concerning for purity or an unusual subtype.
</KEY_FINDINGS>
</ITERATION_2>

<ITERATION_3>
<HYPOTHESES>
1. To further investigate the high LGR5 expression alongside a broader panel of stem/progenitor markers (SOX2, NES, CD44, CD24, PROM1) and definitive epithelial markers (EPCAM, CDH1, VIL1) to support a glial progenitor identity with unusual LGR5 expression, expecting high LGR5, SOX2, NES and low others.
2. To thoroughly investigate the high CD14 and moderate LYZ expression alongside a comprehensive panel of myeloid markers (CD68, CD163, CSF1R, FCGR3A, ITGAM, AIF1, PTPRC) to confirm or rule out myeloid contamination, expecting high additional myeloid markers for contamination or low for an unusual glial subtype.
3. To understand the specific myelin gene expression profile (high PLP1, low MBP) by examining PLP1 alongside other myelin-associated genes (MBP, MOG, MAG, PMP22) and core glial markers (SOX10, S100B), expecting high other myelin genes for a subset or low for a non-myelinating function of PLP1.
</HYPOTHESES>

<GENES_CHECKED>
CD14, CD24, CD44, CDH1, EPCAM, LGR5, LYZ, MBP, NES, PLP1, PMP22, PROM1, S100B, SOX10, SOX2, VIL1
</GENES_CHECKED>

<KEY_FINDINGS>
Glial identity was strongly supported by high PLP1, PMP22, S100B, SOX10, and SOX2. High LGR5 and NES with SOX2 suggested progenitor/stem-like characteristics. Low CD24, CDH1, EPCAM, PROM1, VIL1 ruled out significant mature epithelial or typical progenitor contamination. High CD14 and moderate LYZ remained significant anomalies, strongly suggesting potential myeloid contamination or unusual glial subtype. Low MBP, MOG, MAG despite high PLP1, PMP22 indicated a non-classical myelinating population.
</KEY_FINDINGS>
</ITERATION_3>

<ITERATION_4>
<HYPOTHESES>
1. To definitively resolve the high CD14 and moderate LYZ ambiguity by examining them alongside a comprehensive panel of myeloid markers (CD68, CD163, CSF1R, FCGR3A, ITGAM, AIF1, PTPRC, MRC1, CD33), expecting high additional myeloid markers for contamination or low for a unique glial feature.
2. To better characterize the glial progenitor state with potential stem-like features (high LGR5, SOX2, NES) by examining these alongside a broader panel of neural and glial progenitor markers (CD44, PROM1, ASCL1, OLIG2, PDGFRA, SOX9, GFAP), expecting varying expression to define the subtype.
3. To understand the significance of the specific myelin gene expression profile (high PLP1, PMP22, low MBP, MOG, MAG) by examining these alongside core enteric glial markers (SOX10, S100B, NRXN1, NRXN3, FOXD3, L1CAM), suggesting immature, specialized non-myelinating, or transitional glia.
</HYPOTHESES>

<GENES_CHECKED>
CD14, CD44, FOXD3, L1CAM, LGR5, LYZ, MBP, NES, NRXN1, NRXN3, PLP1, PMP22, PROM1, PTPRC, S100B, SOX10, SOX2, SOX9
</GENES_CHECKED>

<KEY_FINDINGS>
Glial identity was consistently supported by high PLP1, PMP22, S100B, SOX10, NRXN1, NRXN3, SOX2, FOXD3, and L1CAM. High LGR5 and NES with SOX2 strongly supported a progenitor/stem-like characteristic. Low MBP, PROM1, PTPRC, and SOX9, and absence of other myeloid/progenitor markers, argued against significant contamination from mature myeloid or typical progenitors. High CD14 and moderate LYZ persisted but lack of other myeloid markers made significant contamination less likely, suggesting a potential unusual glial subtype or minor contamination. The myelin gene pattern (high PLP1, PMP22, low MBP) indicated a glial population expressing specific myelin-associated proteins but not fully myelinating.
