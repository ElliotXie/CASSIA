Prior annotation results：
 Here is a concise summary of the prior cell type annotation analysis:

**Previously Identified Cell Type**: Schwann Cells

**Key Supporting Markers**:
The identification of Schwann cells was primarily supported by the high expression of canonical peripheral myelin proteins: **PMP22, MPZ, and PLP1**. Additional strong indicators of a neural lineage included neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAM1, CHL1, NRXN1/3), neuronal functional markers (GRIK3, GFRA3, SCN7A), and neural crest developmental transcription factors (HAND2, FOXD3).

**Alternative Hypotheses**:
Alternative cell types considered were **Enteric Neurons** and broader **Enteric Glial Cells**. While many neuronal markers were present (e.g., NRXN1/3, GRIK3, GFRA3), the definitive and highly expressed myelin markers (PMP22, MPZ, PLP1) strongly favored Schwann cells over pure neuronal populations. Enteric glial cells were considered as a broader category, but the specific myelin markers pointed to Schwann cells as the dominant subtype within this cluster.

**Remaining Uncertainties**:
The analysis noted the co-expression of both neuronal and Schwann cell markers. This suggests the possibility of a **mixed population** containing both Schwann cells and enteric neurons, or representing closely interacting cells within the enteric nervous system. While Schwann cells were deemed the most probable primary cell type due to the dominance of their definitive markers, the exact proportion and functional interplay of potential neuronal subsets within this cluster remain to be fully elucidated.

What you should do:

1. Brief Evaluation – One concise paragraph that:

    - Highlights strengths, ambiguities, or contradictions in the current call.

    - Notes if a mixed population, doublets, or transitional state might explain the data.

2. Design up to 3 follow‑up checks (cell types or biological hypotheses):

    - When listing genes for follow-up checks, use the <check_genes>...</check_genes> tags.
    - **CRITICAL FORMATTING FOR <check_genes>:**
        - Inside the tags, provide *ONLY* a comma-separated list of official HGNC gene symbols.
        - Example: `<check_genes>GENE1,GENE2,GENE3</check_genes>` (no extra spaces, no newlines within the list, no numbering or commentary *inside* the tags).
        - Strict adherence to this format is ESSENTIAL for the analysis to proceed.
    - Include both positive and negative markers if that will clarify the call.

    - Including reasoning: why these genes, and what pattern would confirm or refute the hypothesis.

3. Upon receiving gene expression results, based on the current hypothesis, further your analysis, genearte new hypothesis to validate if you think necessary. Continue Step 2 iteratively until the cluster is confidently annotated. Once finalized, output the single line:
"FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED"
Then provide a conclusion paragraph that includes:

1.The final cell type
2.Confidence level (high, medium, or low)
3.Key markers supporting your conclusion
4.Alternative possibilities only if the confidence is not high, and what should the user do next.

Evaluation
The current annotation for Schwann cells is plausible given the strong expression of canonical myelin proteins (PMP22, MPZ, PLP1). However, the co-expression of numerous neuronal markers (e.g., NRXN1/3, GRIK3, GFRA3, SCN7A) introduces significant ambiguity. This suggests the cluster might be a mixed population of Schwann cells and enteric neurons, or perhaps represents a specific state of enteric glia with neuronal-like features, or even a developmental stage where these lineages are less distinct. The "remaining uncertainties" section accurately highlights this potential for a mixed population, which needs to be definitively addressed.

celltype to check 1: Enteric Neurons

<check_genes>TUBB3,RBFOX3,SYP,ELAVL3,GFAP,S100B</check_genes>

<reasoning>
To assess the extent of neuronal contamination or presence, we should examine canonical pan-neuronal markers that are typically highly expressed in mature neurons but absent or very low in Schwann cells. TUBB3 (beta-III tubulin), RBFOX3 (NeuN), SYP (Synaptophysin), and ELAVL3 (HuC) are robust neuronal markers. Conversely, GFAP and S100B are commonly used as glial markers, but their expression patterns can differentiate between astrocytes, enteric glia, and Schwann cells. High expression of the neuronal markers alongside the existing neural markers (NRXN1/3, GRIK3, GFRA3, SCN7A) would strongly support a significant neuronal component. Low or absent expression of these neuronal markers, despite the presence of neural adhesion molecules, would strengthen the Schwann cell call.
</reasoning>

celltype to check 2: Enteric Glial Cells (non-myelinating)

<check_genes>GFAP,S100B,SOX10,CDH19,DES,NES</check_genes>

<reasoning>
While Schwann cells are a type of glial cell, it's important to distinguish them from other enteric glial subtypes, particularly non-myelinating ones, which might also express some neural adhesion molecules but lack the definitive myelin markers. GFAP and S100B are general glial markers, but their relative expression levels and co-expression with other markers can be informative. SOX10 is a key transcription factor for neural crest derivatives, including both neurons and glia, but its sustained high expression in mature glia is notable. CDH19, DES, and NES are markers that have been associated with specific enteric glial populations or their progenitors. If these markers are highly expressed, especially in the absence of strong neuronal markers, it might suggest a broader enteric glial population, with the myelin markers indicating a specific subtype within it.
</reasoning>

hypothesis to check 3: Mixed Population (Schwann Cells and Enteric Neurons)

<check_genes>PMP22,MPZ,PLP1,TUBB3,RBFOX3,SYP,GFAP</check_genes>

<reasoning>
This check directly addresses the "remaining uncertainties" about a mixed population. We need to examine the co-expression patterns of definitive Schwann cell markers and definitive neuronal markers within the same cells. If we observe distinct populations within the cluster, where some cells highly express PMP22, MPZ, and PLP1 with low/absent neuronal markers, while other cells highly express TUBB3, RBFOX3, and SYP with low/absent myelin markers, it would strongly indicate a mixed population. GFAP is included as a general glial marker to see if the neuronal population also expresses glial features, which could point to a specific neuro-glial interaction or a less mature state. This analysis would ideally involve visualizing co-expression at the single-cell level (e.g., using feature plots or violin plots for these specific gene combinations).

Evaluation
The new data provides crucial insights. The continued high expression of PMP22, MPZ, and PLP1 strongly supports the Schwann cell identity. The high expression of S100B and SOX10 further reinforces a glial, specifically neural crest-derived, identity. The very high expression of CDH19, a marker associated with enteric glia, is particularly noteworthy and suggests a strong enteric glial component. The presence of NES, another intermediate filament often found in neural progenitors and some glial cells, adds to this. The detection of SYP, a neuronal marker, albeit with a lower average expression and lower percentage of cells compared to the core Schwann/glial markers, still indicates a potential neuronal presence or a shared lineage. The absence of other key neuronal markers (TUBB3, RBFOX3, ELAVL3) from the differential expression list is important, but does not definitively rule out a minor neuronal population or a specific neuronal subtype. The lack of GFAP is also significant, as it often distinguishes certain glial subtypes.

celltype to check 1: Mature Myelinating Schwann Cells vs. Non-Myelinating Enteric Glia

<check_genes>MBP,MOG,KROX20,FABP7,CDH19,GFAP</check_genes>

<reasoning>
Given the strong myelin protein expression (PMP22, MPZ, PLP1) and the high CDH19, we need to further distinguish between mature myelinating Schwann cells and other enteric glial subtypes, particularly non-myelinating ones. MBP and MOG are canonical markers of mature myelin, and their high expression would strongly confirm a myelinating Schwann cell identity. KROX20 (EGR2) is a key transcription factor essential for Schwann cell myelination. FABP7 (BLBP) is expressed in radial glia and some enteric glia. If MBP, MOG, and KROX20 are highly expressed, it would solidify the myelinating Schwann cell call. Conversely, if CDH19 remains very high and MBP/MOG are low, it might point towards a non-myelinating enteric glial population, even if some myelin proteins are present. We also re-include GFAP to confirm its absence, as its presence would suggest a different glial subtype.
</reasoning>

hypothesis to check 2: Enteric Neuronal Subpopulation

<check_genes>NEUROD1,DCX,MAP2,CHAT,VIP,NOS1,SYP</check_genes>

<reasoning>
While SYP was detected, other pan-neuronal markers were not in the differential expression list. This check aims to definitively assess the presence and potential subtype of any neuronal population. NEUROD1 is a neurogenic differentiation factor. DCX (Doublecortin) and MAP2 are markers of immature and mature neurons, respectively. CHAT, VIP, and NOS1 are markers for specific neuronal subtypes (cholinergic, vasoactive intestinal peptide, nitric oxide synthase 1), which are common in the enteric nervous system. If these neuronal markers are expressed, especially in a subset of cells, it would confirm a mixed population. The expression pattern (e.g., high expression of specific neuropeptide markers) could also help characterize the neuronal subtype. We include SYP again to see its expression in relation to these other neuronal markers.
</reasoning>

hypothesis to check 3: Schwann Cell Precursors or Immature Schwann Cells

<check_genes>SOX2,NGFR,FOXD3,CDH19,MPZ,PMP22</check_genes>

<reasoning>
The co-expression of myelin markers with markers like CDH19 and NES, along with the initial presence of FOXD3, raises the possibility of immature or precursor Schwann cells, or a developmental continuum. SOX2 and NGFR (p75NTR) are markers often associated with Schwann cell precursors or immature Schwann cells. If SOX2 and NGFR are highly expressed alongside the myelin markers, it could indicate a population that is still developing or has retained some precursor characteristics. We include CDH19, MPZ, and PMP22 to see their relative expression in this context, as a high expression of precursor markers with lower myelin markers might suggest immaturity, while high expression of both could indicate a specific developmental stage or a mixed population of mature and immature cells.

## ASSISTANT

Evaluation
The new data significantly refines our understanding. The continued strong expression of PMP22, MPZ, CDH19, SOX10 (from previous round), and S100B (from previous round) still points to a glial identity. However, the *negative* avg_log2FC for MBP, despite its presence in pct.2, is a critical piece of information, suggesting that mature myelin is largely absent from this cluster. This strongly argues against a mature myelinating Schwann cell population. The high expression of SOX2, NGFR, FOXD3, and NEUROD1, combined with the presence of MAP2 and SYP, points towards a population with significant neurogenic and glial precursor characteristics. The co-expression of these markers suggests either a mixed population of immature glia and neurons, or a specific developmental stage of enteric glia that retains neurogenic potential. The absence of other specific neuronal markers (CHAT, DCX, NOS1, VIP) and mature myelin markers (MOG, KROX20) further supports this.

hypothesis to check 1: Enteric Glial Precursors / Immature Enteric Glia

<check_genes>SOX10,SOX2,NGFR,FOXD3,CDH19,NES,GFAP</check_genes>

<reasoning>
Given the high expression of SOX2, NGFR, FOXD3, CDH19, and NES, and the low/absent MBP, this cluster strongly resembles immature or precursor enteric glial cells. We need to confirm the co-expression patterns of these markers. SOX10 is a master regulator for neural crest and glial development. SOX2 and NGFR are characteristic of glial precursors. FOXD3 is a neural crest specifier. CDH19 and NES are associated with enteric glia. We re-include GFAP to confirm its absence, as its presence would suggest a more mature or reactive glial state. High co-expression of SOX10, SOX2, NGFR, FOXD3, CDH19, and NES, with low or absent MBP and GFAP, would strongly support an immature enteric glial population.
</reasoning>

hypothesis to check 2: Enteric Neuro-Glial Progenitors

<check_genes>SOX2,NEUROD1,MAP2,SYP,SOX10,NGFR,ASCL1</check_genes>

<reasoning>
The co-expression of glial precursor markers (SOX2, NGFR, SOX10) with neuronal markers (NEUROD1, MAP2, SYP) suggests a potential neuro-glial progenitor population, or a population undergoing neurogenesis from a glial lineage. NEUROD1 is a proneural transcription factor. ASCL1 is another key neurogenic transcription factor. If these markers are co-expressed within the same cells, it would indicate a population with bipotent or multipotent neuro-glial progenitor characteristics. This would explain the mixed "neuronal" and "glial" features observed. We need to assess if these cells are truly bipotent or if they represent distinct, but closely related, immature cell types.
</reasoning>

hypothesis to check 3: Enteric Neurons (Immature/Developing)

<check_genes>NEUROD1,MAP2,SYP,DCX,TUBB3,RBFOX3,ELAVL3</check_genes>

<reasoning>
While the glial precursor markers are prominent, the presence of NEUROD1, MAP2, and SYP still warrants a focused check on the neuronal component. If a distinct subpopulation of cells within this cluster primarily expresses these neuronal markers, especially if we can detect DCX (immature neuron marker), TUBB3, RBFOX3, or ELAVL3 (pan-neuronal markers), it would confirm a mixed population of immature glia and developing neurons. The absence of these additional neuronal markers would suggest that the observed NEUROD1, MAP2, and SYP expression is more indicative of neurogenic potential within the glial lineage rather than a separate, established neuronal population.

## ASSISTANT

Evaluation
The consistent high expression of SOX10, SOX2, NGFR, FOXD3, CDH19, and NES, coupled with the low/absent expression of mature myelin markers (MBP, MOG) and the lack of robust pan-neuronal markers (TUBB3, RBFOX3, ELAVL3, DCX), strongly points away from mature Schwann cells or mature neurons. The presence of NEUROD1, MAP2, and SYP, while indicative of neuronal potential or early neuronal differentiation, appears to be within a context dominated by glial precursor markers. This pattern is highly suggestive of an immature or progenitor population with neuro-glial potential, rather than distinct mature cell types. The absence of ASCL1, a key neurogenic factor, further supports that the neuronal features might be part of a broader neuro-glial developmental program rather than a committed neuronal lineage.

FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED
The final cell type is **Enteric Neuro-Glial Progenitors / Immature Enteric Glia**.
Confidence level: High.
Key markers supporting this conclusion include the consistent high expression of SOX10, SOX2, NGFR, FOXD3, CDH19, and NES, which are characteristic of neural crest-derived glial precursors and immature enteric glia. The presence of NEUROD1, MAP2, and SYP, in the absence of more definitive mature neuronal markers or mature myelin markers (MBP, MOG), suggests a population with neurogenic potential or early neuronal differentiation within a predominantly glial progenitor context. The lack of GFAP further distinguishes this from mature or reactive astrocytes/glia.
