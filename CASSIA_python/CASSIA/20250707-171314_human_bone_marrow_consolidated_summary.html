        <pre>Here is the consolidated list of the top 3 most likely cell types for the CD56 bright NK cluster:

1.  **Cell Type:** CD56dim Natural Killer (NK) Cells
    **Reasoning:** Consistently ranked as the top hypothesis across all three runs (Run 1 Rank 1, Run 2 Rank 1, Run 3 Rank 1). The reasoning across runs strongly converges on their cytotoxic function, supported by the repeated identification of key cytotoxic marker genes such as GNLY, GZMK, NKG7, KLRD1, and various KIR genes (e.g., KIR2DL4). These markers are characteristic of the most abundant NK cell subtype in peripheral blood, specialized for killing virally infected or tumor cells.

2.  **Cell Type:** CD56bright Natural Killer (NK) Cells
    **Reasoning:** Consistently ranked as the second hypothesis across all three runs (Run 1 Rank 2, Run 2 Rank 2, Run 3 Rank 2). The reasoning consistently highlights their role as cytokine producers and immune regulators, rather than primary cytotoxic effectors. This is supported by the recurring presence of markers like IL2RB, IL18R1/IL18RAP, AREG, GATA3, ID2, and TNFRSF18 (GITR), which are associated with their helper-like or regulatory functions.

        <pre>Here is the consolidated list of cell types based on the provided analysis runs:

1.  **Cell Type:** Naive CD8+ T Cells
    **Reasoning:** This cell type consistently ranks highest across all runs (Rank 1 in Run 1 and Run 2, and implicitly included in Run 2's Rank 1 and Run 3's Rank 2). The strong co-expression of CD8A/CD8B with naive markers like CCR7 and LEF1 is repeatedly cited as key evidence. TCF7 is also noted as supporting a naive state. While Run 3's Rank 1 includes "Effector or Memory," its reasoning still highlights CCR7 and LEF1, which are characteristic of naive cells.

2.  **Cell Type:** Memory CD8+ T Cells (Effector Memory or Central Memory)
    **Reasoning:** Memory CD8+ T cells appear in various forms across all runs (Rank 3 in Run 1, Rank 2 in Run 2, and implicitly in Run 3's Rank 1 and Rank 2). Markers like CCR7, CD27, LEF1, and BCL11B are consistently mentioned as indicators of central or effector memory states. The distinction between central and effector memory is sometimes blurred, but the presence of memory characteristics is a recurring theme.

3.  **Cell Type:** Effector/Cytotoxic CD8+ T Cells
    **Reasoning:** Effector or Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are identified in Run 1 (Rank 2) and Run 2 (Rank 3), and are broadly encompassed by Run 3's Rank 1. The reasoning often points to high expression of CD8A/CD8B, and markers associated with activation and cytotoxic function such as PRKCA, RUNX2, and GRAP2. While some runs emphasize naive or memory states, the potential for an effector phenotype is consistently present.</pre>

        <pre>Here is the consolidated list of cell types for the **Prog_DC** cluster:

1.  **Cell Type:** Proliferating Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells (HSPCs)
    **Reasoning:** This cell type consistently ranked 1st across all three runs. The reasoning in each run strongly emphasizes active division and proliferation, with consistent mention of key mitotic markers such as MKI67, TOP2A, CDK1, AURKB, PLK1, and BIRC5. This indicates a highly proliferative population at the root of hematopoiesis, responsible for replenishing various blood cell lineages.

2.  **Cell Type:** Proliferating Myeloid Progenitor Cells
    **Reasoning:** This cell type appeared as Rank 2 in Run 1 and Run 3, and as Myeloid Progenitors (GMPs) in Run 2 (Rank 3). The consistent presence of proliferation markers (MKI67, TOP2A) alongside myeloid-associated markers like AXL and FCER1A (though FCER1A's myeloid association was noted in Run 3, while Run 1 suggested lymphoid) strongly supports a highly proliferative, committed myeloid lineage. The reasoning across runs highlights their active division and role as precursors in the myeloid lineage.

3.  **Cell Type:** Proliferating Lymphoid Progenitor Cells
    **Reasoning:** This cell type was identified as Rank 3 in Run 1 and Run 3. While Run 2 did not explicitly list "Lymphoid Progenitors," the consistent appearance in two runs, coupled with the general theme of high proliferative activity in progenitor populations, suggests their plausible presence. The reasoning points to progenitor cells committed to the lymphoid lineage exhibiting high proliferation rates, even if explicit lymphoid lineage markers were not consistently highlighted across all runs.</pre>

3.  **Cell Type:** Cytotoxic CD8+ T Cells (Effector/Memory Subset)
    **Reasoning:** Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are consistently ranked among the top three (Rank 3 in Run 1 and Run 2, Rank 2 in Run 3). This is supported by the presence of hallmark cytotoxic genes (GZMK, GZMA, GZMH, GZMM, PRF1, GNLY, NKG7) and markers associated with effector or memory subsets (TBX21, KLRG1, CCL5, LAG3). While sharing some cytotoxic machinery with NK and γδ T cells, the consistent identification of these markers points to a distinct, albeit related, cytotoxic T-cell population.</pre>
