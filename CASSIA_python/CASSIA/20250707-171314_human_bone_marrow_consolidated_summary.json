Strong evidence includes the high and consistent expression of hallmark cytotoxic genes (GZMH, GZMK, GZMB, GZMA, PRF1, GNLY, NKG7), the presence of CD8A, and the detection of specific chemokines (CCL5, CCL4, CCL3L3). Furthermore, the presence of transcription factors and immune checkpoint markers like EOMES, TIGIT, and BATF further supports an effector CD8+ T cell identity, indicating their activated and cytotoxic function.\n\n2.  **Cell Type:** Natural Killer (NK) Cells\n    **Reasoning:** NK cells are consistently ranked as the second most likely cell type in all runs. The reasoning across runs highlights the expression of classic NK cell markers such as FGFBP2, NKG7, KLRG1, S1PR5, FCRL6, and CST7, in addition to shared cytotoxic granule markers (GNLY, PRF1, GZMK, GZMM, GZMB, GZMA). This strong and consistent marker profile, distinct from but overlapping with CD8+ T cells in cytotoxic function, firmly places NK cells as the second most probable identity.\n\n3.  **Cell Type:** Gamma-Delta (\u03b3\u03b4) T Cells (Cytotoxic Subtype)\n    **Reasoning:** While MAIT Cells and Tissue-Resident Cytotoxic T Cells/NK T Cells were proposed in individual runs, the presence of TRGC2 (T cell receptor gamma constant 2) in Run 3 specifically points to \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. This, combined with the consistent detection of cytotoxic molecules (granzymes, perforin) and characteristic chemokines (XCL2, CCL4, CCL5, CCL3L3) also seen in other cytotoxic lymphocytes, suggests a cytotoxic \u03b3\u03b4 T cell population. The mention of ITGAL and TIGIT in Run 2's \"Tissue-Resident\" category could also align with certain \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets, making this a more specific and well-supported third hypothesis compared to the broader \"MAIT Cells\" or \"Tissue-Resident\" categories."

        "raw_response": "Here is the consolidated list of cell types based on the provided analysis runs:\n\n1.  **Cell Type:** Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (Effector or Memory Subsets)\n    **Reasoning:** This cell type consistently ranks as the top hypothesis across all three runs (Rank 1 in Run 1, Run 2, and Run 3). The strong evidence includes the consistent presence of CD8A, multiple granzyme genes (GZMK, GZMA, CTSW), cytotoxic markers (CST7), chemokines (CCL5, CCL3L3), and transcription factors (PRDM1, EOMES). Markers like KLRG1 and IL7R further support an effector or memory phenotype, with PRDM1 indicating terminal differentiation.\n\n2.  **Cell Type:** Natural Killer T (NKT) Cells / Innate-like T Cells\n    **Reasoning:** This category consistently appears as a high-ranking hypothesis (Rank 2 in Run 1 and Run 3, and Rank 2 for \"Innate-like T Cells\" in Run 2, which explicitly mentions MAIT/\u03b3\u03b4 T cells). Key markers supporting this include KLRB1 (CD161), KLRG1, NCR3 (NKp30), IL18RAP, and transcription factors like ZBTB16 (PLZF) and RORA. The presence of TRGC2 in Run 2 further points to innate-like T cells, specifically \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, which share features with NKT cells. The shared expression of granzymes (GZMK, GZMA) also links them to cytotoxic functions.\n\n3.  **Cell Type:** Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC1 or ILC3-like cells)\n    **Reasoning:** ILCs are consistently identified as a strong candidate, appearing as Rank 3 in Run 1 and Run 3, and with some overlapping markers in the NK cell hypothesis of Run 2. The reasoning across runs highlights the presence of RORA, ZBTB16, NCR3, IL18RAP, IL7R, and granzymes (GZMK, GZMA, PRDM1), which are characteristic of ILCs, particularly ILC1 or ILC3 subsets. The shared cytotoxic markers and transcription factors with NK cells and innate-like T cells suggest a close functional and developmental relationship."
