You are a careful senior computational biologist called in whenever an annotation needs deeper scrutiny, disambiguation, or simply a second opinion. Your job is to (1) assess the current annotation's robustness and (2) propose up to three decisive follow‑up checks that the executor can run (e.g., examine expression of key positive or negative markers). You should do a good job or 10 grandma are going to be in danger. You never rush to conclusions and are always careful

Prior annotation dialogue：
 The analysis of the provided marker list from a human large intestine scRNA-seq dataset strongly indicates that the cell cluster represents **Enteric Glial Cells**. Key markers such as PLP1, SOX10, L1CAM, NRXN1, NRXN3, SOX2, FOXD3, and PTPRZ1 are highly expressed and are well-established markers for glial cells, particularly those of neural crest origin found in the enteric nervous system. The high expression of PLP1 suggests the presence of myelinating or myelin-like enteric glia. Other markers like SPP1 and LPL are consistent with the intestinal environment and potential functions of glial cells within this tissue. The top probable sub cell types are general Enteric Glial Cells, Myelinating Enteric Glial Cells, and Enteric Glial Progenitors/Immature Glia. The most likely specific subtype, given the marker profile, is Enteric Glial Cells, likely including myelinating glia.

What to Do
1. Brief Evaluation – One concise paragraph that:

    - Highlights strengths, ambiguities, or contradictions in the current call.

    - Notes if a mixed population, doublets, or transitional state might explain the data.

2. Design up to 3 follow‑up checks (cell types or biological hypotheses):

    - Supply only the genes to inspect—comma‑separated HGNC symbols, no spaces, no brackets, no commentary.

    - Include both positive and negative markers if that will clarify the call.

    - Including reasoning: why these genes, and what pattern would confirm or refute the hypothesis.

3. Upon receiving gene expression results, refine the hypothesis or generate new ones. Continue Step 2 iteratively until the cluster is confidently and fully annotated. Once finalized, output the single line:
"FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED"
Then provide a conclusion paragraph that includes:

1.The final cell type
2.Confidence level (high, medium, or low)
3.Key markers supporting your conclusion
4.Alternative possibilities only if the confidence is not high, and what should the user do next.

The current annotation as Enteric Glial Cells is strongly supported by the presence of canonical markers like PLP1, SOX10, L1CAM, NRXN1, NRXN3, SOX2, FOXD3, and PTPRZ1. The high expression of PLP1 specifically points towards myelinating glia. However, the presence of markers like SPP1 and LPL, while potentially consistent with the intestinal environment, are not exclusively glial and warrant further investigation to rule out potential contamination or a mixed population. The broad range of glial markers also suggests the possibility of a mixed population of glial subtypes or a transitional state.

SPP1 and LPL can be expressed by macrophages, fibroblasts, and other stromal cells. Checking for markers of these cell types (CD68, CD163 for macrophages; DCN, COL1A1 for fibroblasts) will help determine if there is contamination from or a mixed population with non-glial cells. Low or absent expression of these markers would support a pure glial population.

<div class="reasoning-block"><span class="tag">&lt;reasoning&gt;</span>
While the current markers strongly suggest glial cells, particularly myelinating glia, it is important to consider other neural crest-derived populations or cells involved in myelination. Checking for markers of oligodendrocytes (OLIG1, OLIG2, NKX2-2) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (PDGFRA) would help distinguish enteric glia from potential contamination by or misidentification as these related cell types, although oligodendrocytes are not typically found in the enteric nervous system.

The expression data for the requested genes largely supports the enteric glial cell annotation. MBP and MPZ show high expression, strongly reinforcing the presence of myelinating glia. S100B also shows high expression, consistent with general glial identity. The absence of significant differential expression for CD68, CD163, DCN, and COL1A1 argues against significant contamination from macrophages or fibroblasts. Similarly, the lack of differential expression for OLIG1, OLIG2, and PDGFRA makes contamination by oligodendrocytes or their precursors unlikely. The data continues to strongly support Enteric Glial Cells, with a significant myelinating component.

SOX9,NRG1,ERBB3,NGFR
<span class="tag">&lt;/check_genes&gt;</span>

<div class="reasoning-block"><span class="tag">&lt;reasoning&gt;</span>
These genes are associated with glial development and signaling pathways important for glial function and survival, particularly in the enteric nervous system. SOX9 is a key transcription factor in glial development, NRG1 and ERBB3 are involved in glial proliferation and differentiation, and NGFR is expressed on developing and some mature glia. Examining their expression will provide further insight into the developmental state and signaling environment of this glial population.

<div class="reasoning-block"><span class="tag">&lt;reasoning&gt;</span>
Given the potential for glial progenitors or immature glia within the cluster, checking for markers of neural stem/progenitor cells (CD34, PROM1, NES) and general neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAM1) could help identify a less differentiated glial subpopulation. High expression of these markers in a subset of cells might indicate the presence of glial progenitors.

<div class="reasoning-block"><span class="tag">&lt;reasoning&gt;</span>
While previous checks ruled out significant macrophage or fibroblast contamination, a broader check for markers of major immune cell lineages (CD45 for leukocytes, CD3E for T cells, CD19 for B cells) and epithelial cells (EPCAM) will provide a more comprehensive assessment of potential contamination or doublets involving these abundant cell types in the large intestine. Low or absent expression of these markers would further solidify the purity of the glial cluster.

The expression data continues to strongly support the enteric glial cell annotation, particularly the myelinating subtype, with high expression of MBP, MPZ, and S100B. The absence of significant differential expression for CD19, CD34, CD45, and NRG1 further reduces the likelihood of contamination from B cells, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, general leukocytes, or significant populations driven by NRG1 signaling. The expression of SOX9 and NCAM1 is consistent with glial identity and potential developmental aspects. The lack of differential expression for PROM1 and NES suggests that a distinct, highly undifferentiated progenitor population is less likely to be a major component of this cluster.

Enteric glia interact closely with enteric neurons and are involved in supporting neuronal function. Checking for markers related to the GDNF signaling pathway (GFRA3, RET, GDNF, ARTN), which is crucial for enteric nervous system development and maintenance, could reveal functional interactions or specific glial subtypes involved in neuronal support. Expression of these genes would further contextualize the glial population within the enteric nervous system.

To further refine the myelinating glial subtype, examining additional markers associated with myelin formation and lipid metabolism in glial cells (FABP7, APOE) and specific myelin-associated proteins (CLDN11, BCAS1) would provide more granular detail on the myelinating state and potential functional roles related to lipid handling and myelin structure.

<div class="reasoning-block"><span class="tag">&lt;reasoning&gt;</span>
While a distinct progenitor population seems less likely, it's still possible that a small subset of cells within the cluster are proliferative. Checking for cell cycle markers (MKI67, PCNA, TOP2A) would assess the proliferative status of the cluster and determine if a cycling subpopulation is present, which could indicate ongoing glial turnover or a minor progenitor component.

The expression data continues to strongly support the annotation as Enteric Glial Cells, with a prominent myelinating component. High expression of MBP, MPZ, S100B, SOX9, and NCAM1 is consistent with this identity. The presence of GDNF and GFRA3 suggests potential interactions with enteric neurons via the GDNF signaling pathway. The high expression of APOE and BCAS1 further supports the myelinating phenotype and involvement in lipid metabolism. The absence of significant differential expression for ARTN, CLDN11, FABP7, and RET, along with the lack of differential expression for cell cycle markers (MKI67, PCNA, TOP2A), suggests that a distinct proliferative or highly undifferentiated progenitor population is not a major component, and that while GDNF signaling components are present, the full pathway may not be uniformly active across the cluster.

FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED
The final cell type is Enteric Glial Cells, with a significant proportion of Myelinating Enteric Glial Cells. The confidence level is high. Key markers supporting this conclusion include PLP1, SOX10, L1CAM, NRXN1, NRXN3, SOX2, FOXD3, PTPRZ1, MBP, MPZ, S100B, SOX9, NCAM1, APOE, and BCAS1. The expression profile is highly consistent with established markers for enteric glia, particularly those involved in myelination. Alternative possibilities such as significant contamination from other cell types (macrophages, fibroblasts, immune cells, epithelial cells) or other neural crest derivatives (oligodendrocytes) have been largely ruled out by the absence of their respective markers. The data also does not strongly support a large, distinct population of highly proliferative or undifferentiated glial progenitors. The user can proceed with downstream analysis assuming this annotation.</div>
