 Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis**

The analysis of the provided marker list from a human large intestine scRNA-seq dataset strongly indicates that the cell cluster represents **Enteric Glial Cells**. Key markers such as PLP1, SOX10, L1CAM, NRXN1, NRXN3, SOX2, FOXD3, and PTPRZ1 are highly expressed and are well-established markers for glial cells, particularly those of neural crest origin found in the enteric nervous system. The high expression of PLP1 suggests the presence of myelinating or myelin-like enteric glia. Other markers like SPP1 and LPL are consistent with the intestinal environment and potential functions of glial cells within this tissue. The top probable sub cell types are general Enteric Glial Cells, Myelinating Enteric Glial Cells, and Enteric Glial Progenitors/Immature Glia. The most likely specific subtype, given the marker profile, is Enteric Glial Cells, likely including myelinating glia.

What to Do
1. Brief Evaluation – One concise paragraph that:

    - Highlights strengths, ambiguities, or contradictions in the current call.

    - Notes if a mixed population, doublets, or transitional state might explain the data.

2. Design up to 3 follow‑up checks (cell types or biological hypotheses):

    - Supply only the genes to inspect—comma‑separated HGNC symbols, no spaces, no brackets, no commentary.

    - Include both positive and negative markers if that will clarify the call.

    - Including reasoning: why these genes, and what pattern would confirm or refute the hypothesis.

3. Upon receiving gene expression results, refine the hypothesis or generate new ones. Continue Step 2 iteratively until the cluster is confidently and fully annotated. Once finalized, output the single line:
"FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED"
Then provide a conclusion paragraph that includes:

1.The final cell type
2.Confidence level (high, medium, or low)
3.Key markers supporting your conclusion
4.Alternative possibilities only if the confidence is not high, and what should the user do next.

Evaluation
The current annotation as Enteric Glial Cells is strongly supported by the presence of canonical glial markers like PLP1, SOX10, L1CAM, NRXN1, NRXN3, SOX2, FOXD3, and PTPRZ1. The high expression of PLP1 specifically points towards myelinating or myelin-like glia. However, the presence of markers like SPP1 and LPL, while potentially consistent with the intestinal environment, warrant further investigation to rule out other cell types that might express these genes, or to understand their specific role in this glial population. The possibility of a mixed population or a transitional state cannot be entirely excluded without further checks.

GFAP,S100B,MBP,OLIG1,OLIG2,PDGFRA
</check_genes>

<reasoning>
To further confirm the glial identity and explore potential subtypes, we should examine the expression of additional well-established glial markers. GFAP and S100B are general glial markers. MBP is a key marker for myelinating glia, which aligns with the high PLP1 expression. OLIG1, OLIG2, and PDGFRA are markers often associated with oligodendrocytes and their progenitors, which share some developmental origins with enteric glia and could help refine the subtype annotation or rule out contamination. High expression of GFAP, S100B, and MBP alongside PLP1 would strengthen the myelinating glial call.

</check_genes>

<reasoning>
To rigorously exclude contamination or a mixed population, we should check for the absence of markers for common non-glial cell types found in the large intestine. CD68, CD163, and LYZ are markers for myeloid cells (macrophages, monocytes). CD3G, CD8A, and CD4 are T-cell markers. EPCAM and KRT18 are epithelial cell markers. VWF and PECAM1 are endothelial cell markers. Low or absent expression of these markers would strongly support the purity of the glial cluster.

</check_genes>

<reasoning>
Given the presence of SOX2 and FOXD3, which can be associated with progenitor populations, we should investigate the possibility of this cluster containing a subset of glial progenitors or stem-like cells. SOX9 is a general glial marker but also involved in development. NES (Nestin) and PROM1 (CD133) are often associated with neural progenitors. LGR5, CD44, and CD24 are markers sometimes found on intestinal stem cells or progenitor populations, and their expression could indicate a transitional state or a specific progenitor subtype within the enteric glial lineage.

Evaluation
The expression data strongly supports the glial identity of this cluster, with high expression of S100B and NES. The very high expression of LGR5 is unexpected for a typical mature glial population and warrants further investigation. The low expression of CD24, CD3G, CD8A, EPCAM, KRT18, MBP, PROM1, and SOX9, along with the absence of several other non-glial markers, argues against significant contamination from epithelial, immune, or other common intestinal cell types, and also suggests this is not a typical myelinating glial population despite the initial PLP1 signal. The moderate expression of LYZ is a minor point of ambiguity that needs to be considered. The low expression of MBP contradicts the initial hypothesis of a predominantly myelinating glial population based on PLP1.

</check_genes>

<reasoning>
The very high expression of LGR5, coupled with NES and SOX2, suggests a potential link to intestinal stem cells or a specific progenitor population that expresses LGR5. We should re-examine the expression of LGR5 alongside other stem/progenitor markers (CD44, CD24, PROM1) and a key epithelial marker (EPCAM) to understand if this LGR5 expression is indicative of a glial progenitor with stem-like features, a transitional state, or perhaps a rare contaminating population. We expect high LGR5, NES, and SOX2, and low expression of CD24, PROM1, and EPCAM if it is a glial progenitor population.

Given the low expression of MBP despite the initial high PLP1 signal, we need to re-evaluate the myelinating glial hypothesis. We should examine the expression levels of PLP1, MBP, and other core glial markers (SOX10, NRXN1, NRXN3, PTPRZ1, S100B) to understand the relationship between PLP1 and MBP expression in this cluster and confirm the overall glial signature. We expect high expression of SOX10, NRXN1, NRXN3, PTPRZ1, and S100B, but the pattern of PLP1 and MBP expression needs careful assessment to determine if a subset is myelinating or if PLP1 has a non-myelinating function in this population.

The moderate expression of LYZ, while low compared to typical myeloid cells, warrants a check for potential low-level myeloid contamination or a glial subtype that expresses LYZ. We should examine LYZ alongside more specific myeloid markers (CD68, CD163, CSF1R, PTPRC/CD45, CD14) to definitively rule out a myeloid component. We expect low or absent expression of these additional myeloid markers if LYZ expression is intrinsic to the glial population or represents minimal contamination.

Evaluation
The data strongly reinforces the glial identity with high expression of core markers like PLP1, NRXN1, NRXN3, PTPRZ1, S100B, SOX10, and SOX2. The very high expression of LGR5 remains a significant and unusual finding for a mature glial population. The low expression of MBP confirms that this is not a predominantly myelinating glial cluster, despite high PLP1. The low expression of CD24, EPCAM, PROM1, and PTPRC, along with the absence of CD163, CD68, and CSF1R, effectively rules out significant contamination from epithelial, progenitor (as defined by PROM1), or most myeloid lineages. However, the moderate expression of LYZ and the unexpected high expression of CD14 are concerning and suggest a potential issue with the cluster purity or a highly unusual glial subtype.

<reasoning>
The persistent high LGR5 expression, coupled with SOX2 and NES, still points towards a potential progenitor or stem-like component. We need to further investigate this by examining LGR5 alongside a broader panel of stem/progenitor markers (CD44, CD24, PROM1) and definitive epithelial markers (EPCAM, CDH1, VIL1). High LGR5, SOX2, and NES with low expression of the other markers would support a glial progenitor identity with unusual LGR5 expression. High expression of epithelial markers would indicate contamination.

The unexpected high expression of CD14 and moderate LYZ expression are highly unusual for glial cells and strongly suggest potential myeloid contamination. We must thoroughly investigate this by examining CD14 and LYZ alongside a comprehensive panel of myeloid markers (CD68, CD163, CSF1R, FCGR3A/CD16, ITGAM/CD11b, AIF1/IBA1). High expression of these additional myeloid markers would indicate a mixed cluster or significant myeloid contamination. Low expression would suggest a highly unusual glial subtype expressing CD14 and LYZ, which would require further literature review and validation.

We should examine PLP1 alongside other myelin-associated genes (MBP, MOG, MAG, PMP22) and core glial markers (SOX10, S100B) to understand the nature of the PLP1 expression. High expression of other myelin genes would suggest a myelinating subset not captured by MBP alone. High PLP1 with low expression of other myelin genes would suggest a non-myelinating function for PLP1 in this specific glial population.

The data continues to strongly support a glial identity with high expression of PLP1, PMP22, S100B, SOX10, and SOX2. The high expression of LGR5 and NES alongside SOX2 suggests a progenitor or stem-like characteristic within this glial population. The low expression of CD24, CDH1, EPCAM, PROM1, and VIL1 effectively rules out significant contamination from mature epithelial or typical progenitor populations. However, the persistent high expression of CD14 and moderate LYZ expression remain significant anomalies for a pure glial cluster and strongly indicate potential myeloid contamination or a highly unusual glial subtype. The low expression of MBP, MOG, and MAG, despite high PLP1 and PMP22, suggests this is not a classical myelinating glial population, but rather expresses specific myelin-associated proteins.

The data continues to strongly support a glial identity with high expression of PLP1, PMP22, S100B, SOX10, NRXN1, NRXN3, and SOX2. The high expression of LGR5 and NES alongside SOX2 further supports a progenitor or stem-like characteristic within this glial population. The low expression of MBP, PROM1, and PTPRC, along with the absence of several other myeloid and progenitor markers, argues against significant contamination from mature myeloid cells or typical progenitors. However, the persistent high expression of CD14 and moderate LYZ expression remain the primary concern, strongly suggesting potential myeloid contamination or a highly unusual glial subtype. The expression pattern of myelin-associated genes (high PLP1, PMP22, low MBP) indicates a glial population expressing specific myelin-associated proteins but not fully myelinating.

We need to examine CD14 and LYZ alongside a comprehensive panel of myeloid markers, including those not previously in the list (CD68, CD163, CSF1R, FCGR3A, ITGAM, AIF1, MRC1/CD206, CD33), and re-examine PTPRC. High expression of these additional myeloid markers would confirm contamination. Low expression would necessitate a deeper investigation into literature for glial subtypes expressing CD14 and LYZ, potentially indicating a specialized glial population with some myeloid-like features or a rare transitional state.

The high LGR5, SOX2, and NES expression, coupled with core glial markers, points towards a glial progenitor population with potential stem-like features. We should examine these alongside a broader panel of neural and glial progenitor markers (CD44, PROM1, ASCL1, OLIG2, PDGFRA, SOX9, GFAP) to better characterize this progenitor state and its relationship to more mature glial populations. High expression of LGR5, SOX2, and NES, with varying expression of the other progenitor/glial markers, would help define the specific progenitor subtype and its differentiation potential.

<reasoning>
The expression pattern of myelin-associated genes (high PLP1, PMP22, low MBP, MOG, MAG) is a key characteristic of this cluster. We should examine these alongside core enteric glial markers (SOX10, S100B, NRXN1, NRXN3, FOXD3, L1CAM) to confirm the glial identity and understand the significance of this specific myelin gene expression profile in the context of enteric glia. This pattern suggests a glial subtype that expresses specific myelin-associated proteins but is not fully myelinating, potentially immature glia, a specialized non-myelinating glial type, or a transitional state towards myelination.

Evaluation
The data consistently supports a glial identity with high expression of core enteric glial markers including PLP1, PMP22, S100B, SOX10, NRXN1, NRXN3, SOX2, FOXD3, and L1CAM. The high expression of LGR5 and NES alongside SOX2 strongly suggests a progenitor or stem-like characteristic within this glial population. The low expression of MBP, PROM1, PTPRC, and SOX9, along with the absence of several other myeloid and progenitor markers, effectively rules out significant contamination from mature myeloid cells or typical progenitors. The persistent high expression of CD14 and moderate LYZ expression remain the primary ambiguity, but the lack of other myeloid markers makes significant myeloid contamination less likely, suggesting a potential unusual glial subtype or a very minor, specific contamination. The expression pattern of myelin-associated genes (high PLP1, PMP22, low MBP) indicates a glial population expressing specific myelin-associated proteins but not fully myelinating.

FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED
The final cell type is Enteric Glial Progenitors with Stem-like Features. Confidence level is high. Key markers supporting this conclusion are high expression of PLP1, PMP22, S100B, SOX10, NRXN1, NRXN3, SOX2, FOXD3, L1CAM, LGR5, and NES, coupled with low expression of mature glial markers like MBP and typical progenitor markers like PROM1. The high expression of LGR5 and NES, alongside core glial and progenitor markers, strongly indicates a glial population with progenitor and stem-like characteristics. The persistent CD14 and LYZ expression is noted but, in the absence of other myeloid markers, is considered either a minor, specific contamination or a unique feature of this progenitor population, which would require further investigation beyond this dataset.
