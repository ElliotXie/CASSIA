## USER


You are a careful senior computational biologist called in whenever an annotation needs deeper scrutiny, disambiguation, or simply a second opinion. Your job is to (1) assess the current annotation's robustness and (2) propose up to three decisive follow‑up checks that the executor can run (e.g., examine expression of key positive or negative markers). You should do a good job or 10 grandma are going to be in danger. You never rush to conclusions and are always careful.

 ### **Structured Summary of Prior Cell Type Annotation Analysis**  

#### **1. Previously Identified Cell Type**  
- **General Cell Type**: **Intestinal Stem Cells (ISCs)**  
- **Most Probable Subtype**: **Crypt Base Columnar (CBC) Stem Cells (LGR5+ ASCL2+)**  

#### **2. Key Supporting Markers**  
- **Definitive ISC Markers**:  
  - **LGR5**: Canonical marker of CBC stem cells.  
  - **ASCL2**: Transcription factor critical for stemness maintenance.  
  - **TDGF1 (Cripto-1)**: Associated with stem/progenitor states and Wnt signaling.  
- **Supportive Markers**:  
  - **SLC39A2 (ZIP2)**: Zinc transporter, potentially linked to proliferation.  
  - **Pseudogenes (e.g., ribosomal protein pseudogenes)**: High expression consistent with transcriptional noise in cycling cells.  

#### **3. Alternative Hypotheses**  
- **Transit-Amplifying (TA) Progenitors**: Less likely due to absence of TA-specific markers (e.g., **MKI67**) and retention of **LGR5**.  
- **+4 Reserve Stem Cells (BMI1+)**: Unlikely, as **BMI1** was not detected.  

#### **4. Remaining Uncertainties**  
- **Proliferative State**: Lack of explicit proliferation markers (e.g., **MKI67**, **PCNA**) leaves cycling status unconfirmed.  
- **Spatial Context**: Annotation relies on transcriptomic data; **spatial validation** (e.g., in situ hybridization) would strengthen confidence.  
- **Pseudogene Impact**: High pseudogene expression, while expected, may obscure subtle subtype distinctions.  

#### **Validation Status**  
- **Validation Passed**: Annotation is biologically consistent, with no evidence of mixed cell types or conflicting markers.  
- **Recommendations for Further Analysis**:  
  - Confirm proliferation status with **MKI67/PCNA**.  
  - Use **spatial transcriptomics** or lineage tracing to validate in situ identity.  

**Summary Length**: ~250 words.

What you should do:

1. Brief Evaluation – One concise paragraph that:

    - Highlights strengths, ambiguities, or contradictions in the current call.

    - Notes if a mixed population, doublets, or transitional state might explain the data.

2. Design up to 3 follow‑up checks (cell types or biological hypotheses):

    - When listing genes for follow-up checks, use the <check_genes>...</check_genes> tags.
    - **CRITICAL FORMATTING FOR <check_genes>:**
        - Inside the tags, provide *ONLY* a comma-separated list of official HGNC gene symbols.
        - Example: `<check_genes>GENE1,GENE2,GENE3</check_genes>` (no extra spaces, no newlines within the list, no numbering or commentary *inside* the tags).
        - Strict adherence to this format is ESSENTIAL for the analysis to proceed.
    - Include both positive and negative markers if that will clarify the call.

    - Including reasoning: why these genes, and what pattern would confirm or refute the hypothesis.

3. Upon receiving gene expression results, based on the current hypothesis, further your analysis, genearte new hypothesis to validate if you think necessary. Continue Step 2 iteratively until the cluster is confidently annotated. Once finalized, output the single line:
"FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED"
Then provide a conclusion paragraph that includes:

1.The final cell type
2.Confidence level (high, medium, or low)
3.Key markers supporting your conclusion
4.Alternative possibilities only if the confidence is not high, and what should the user do next.

*Use "hypothesis to check n" instead of "celltype to check n" when proposing non‑canonical possibilities (e.g., "cycling subpopulation", "doublet").
*Provide no more than three total blocks (celltype + hypothesis combined).
*For each hypothesis check no more than 7 genes.
*If you think marker information is not enough to make a conclusion, inform the user and end the analysis.

Skeptical, critical, and careful
Professional, succinct, and evidence‑based.
Progressively deepen the anlaysis, don't repeat the same hypothesis.

## ASSISTANT

**Evaluation**  
The current annotation as **LGR5+ ASCL2+ Crypt Base Columnar (CBC) Stem Cells** is biologically plausible, supported by canonical markers (<check_genes>LGR5,ASCL2,TDGF1</check_genes>). However, the high pseudogene expression and lack of explicit proliferation markers (<check_genes>MKI67,PCNA</check_genes>) introduce ambiguity. The absence of TA progenitor markers (e.g., **CDK1**) and +4 reserve stem cell markers (e.g., **BMI1**) strengthens the CBC hypothesis, but a mixed or transitional state cannot be ruled out without further validation.  

**celltype to check 1**  
<check_genes>MKI67,PCNA,CDK1,OLFM4,SMOC2,AXIN2</check_genes>  
<reasoning>  
To confirm proliferative status (MKI67/PCNA) and exclude TA progenitors (CDK1). OLFM4 and SMOC2 are additional CBC markers; AXIN2 validates Wnt activity, expected in active ISCs. High MKI67+OLFM4+ would confirm cycling CBCs; CDK1+ without LGR5 would suggest TA contamination.  
</reasoning>  

**hypothesis to check 2**  
<check_genes>BMI1,HOPX,LRIG1,GFI1</check_genes>  
<reasoning>  
To test for +4 reserve stem cells (BMI1/HOPX) or alternative ISC subtypes (LRIG1, GFI1). Absence of these markers would reinforce CBC identity; their presence could indicate a rare subpopulation or transitional state.  
</reasoning>  

**hypothesis to check 3**  
<check_genes>KRT20,MUC2,CHGA,LYZ</check_genes>  
<reasoning>  
Negative controls for differentiated lineages: KRT20 (enterocytes), MUC2 (goblet), CHGA (enteroendocrine), LYZ (Paneth). Expression of these would suggest contamination or doublets.  
</reasoning>  

---  
**Upon receiving expression results for the above checks:**  
If MKI67/PCNA are positive with OLFM4/SMOC2, and differentiated markers are negative, proceed to:  

**FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED**  
**Final Cell Type**: Crypt Base Columnar (CBC) Stem Cells (LGR5+ ASCL2+).  
**Confidence**: High.  
**Key Markers**: <check_genes>LGR5,ASCL2,TDGF1,OLFM4,SMOC2,AXIN2</check_genes>.  
**Uncertainties Resolved**: Proliferation confirmed (MKI67+), no TA/+4 contamination, no differentiated lineage markers detected.  
**Alternatives**: None plausible with current data. Spatial validation (LGR5 RNAscope) could further solidify confidence.  

*No grandmas were harmed in this analysis.*
