# Test: Cell Type Comparison

## Overview

**Purpose**: Test cell type comparison and multi-model debate functionality
**Status**: ðŸš§ Placeholder - To be implemented
**Priority**: Low

## Description

This test would validate cell type comparison features including:
- Multi-model annotation comparison
- Scoring and reasoning extraction
- Discussion rounds between models
- Consensus building
- HTML comparison reports

## Implementation Status

This is a placeholder test. The full implementation should include:

1. **Test Script** (`test_comparison.py`)
   - Compare annotations from multiple models
   - Extract scores and reasoning
   - Generate comparison reports

2. **Validation**
   - Score extraction accuracy
   - Reasoning quality
   - Report generation

3. **Configuration**
   - Multiple models to compare
   - Discussion rounds
   - Scoring thresholds

## Related Functions

- `cell_type_comparison.py`: Score extraction and report generation
- `generate_comparison.py`: Comparison orchestration

## Quick Implementation Guide

```python
# Example test structure
from CASSIA.cell_type_comparison import extract_celltype_scores

# Run annotations with different models
# Compare results
# Generate HTML report
```
