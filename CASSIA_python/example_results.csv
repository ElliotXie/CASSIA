Without the details of the marker set, I cannot provide a comprehensive analysis. 

To perform a detailed cell type scoring, I would need:
1. The specific markers in order
2. Their presence/absence or expression levels

If you provide the full marker set details, I can give a professional biological analysis using the following criteria:
- Molecular markers specific to each cell type
- Typical surface protein expression
- Immunological classification principles
- Differential marker interpretation

Would you like to provide the complete marker set for analysis?"
