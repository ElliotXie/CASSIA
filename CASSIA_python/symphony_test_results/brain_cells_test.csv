deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324,Dr. Alan Turing,brain cortex,human,initial,success,95,"Neurons are best identified by markers such as **RBFOX3 (NeuN)**, **MAP2**, **SYP (Synaptophysin)**, **TUBB3 (Î²-III-Tubulin)**, and **GAD1**. These markers are highly specific:  
- **RBFOX3/NeuN**: A definitive nuclear marker for mature neurons.  
- **MAP2**: A microtubule-associated protein expressed in neuronal dendrites.  
- **SYP**: A synaptic vesicle protein, indicating synaptic activity.  
- **TUBB3**: A neuron-specific cytoskeletal marker.  
- **GAD1**: Expressed in GABAergic neurons, further confirming neuronal identity.  
Other markers (GFAP, IBA1, P2RY12, etc.) are absent or irrelevant in neurons, supporting high specificity.",90,"Astrocytes are primarily marked by **GFAP**, **S100B**, **AQP4**, and **ALDH1L1**:  
- **GFAP**: The most widely used intermediate filament in astrocytes.  
- **S100B**: A calcium-binding protein highly expressed in astrocytes.  
- **AQP4**: A water channel enriched in astrocytic endfeet at blood vessels.  
- **ALDH1L1**: A metabolic enzyme with high astrocyte specificity.  
The presence of neuron-specific (**RBFOX3, MAP2**) and microglial (**IBA1, P2RY12**) markers in the set does not diminish astrocyte confidence, as their absence strengthens specificity. However, **OLIG2** (an oligodendrocyte marker) is weakly expressed in some astrocytes, slightly reducing specificity.",92,"Microglia are best identified by **IBA1**, **P2RY12**, **TMEM119**, and **CX3CR1**:  
- **IBA1/Ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1**: A widely used microglial marker.  
- **P2RY12**: A purinergic receptor highly specific to homeostatic microglia.  
- **TMEM119**: A transmembrane protein exclusive to microglia in the brain.  
- **CX3CR1**: A chemokine receptor expressed in microglia (also in monocytes).  
While **CD45** (a pan-leukocyte marker) is weakly supportive, its presence confirms immune lineage. Contamination from **GFAP**, **NEUN**, or **OLIG2** is absent, ensuring high confidence. The absence of astrocyte (**ALDH1L1, S100B**) and oligodendrocyte (**OLIG2**) markers reinforces specificity.",N/A
google/gemini-2.5-flash,Dr. Ada Lovelace,brain cortex,human,initial,success,98,"Several markers in the provided list are highly indicative of neuronal cell types.
- **RBFOX3 (NeuN)**: This is a classic and very widely used neuronal nuclear marker. Its presence is strong evidence for neurons. The list also explicitly includes **NEUN**, which is the protein encoded by RBFOX3, reinforcing its relevance.
- **MAP2 (Microtubule-Associated Protein 2)**: MAP2 is a prominent neuronal cytoskeletal marker, particularly enriched in dendrites. Its expression is a good indicator of mature neurons.
- **SYP (Synaptophysin)**: Synaptophysin is an integral membrane glycoprotein found in the presynaptic vesicles of neurons. It is a robust marker for synaptic terminals and active neurons.
- **TUBB3 (Beta-III Tubulin)**: This is a neuronal-specific tubulin isoform found in differentiating and mature neurons, especially in their axons. It's a general neuronal marker, often used to identify neuronal cells in mixed cultures or tissues.
- **GAD1 (Glutamate Decarboxylase 1)**: GAD1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in GABA synthesis. While not all neurons are GABAergic, the presence of GAD1 strongly indicates a specific subpopulation of inhibitory neurons, which are a significant component of the neuronal population in the cortex.
The combination of nuclear (NeuN/RBFOX3), cytoskeletal (MAP2, TUBB3), synaptic (SYP), and functional/neurotransmitter (GAD1) markers provides a comprehensive and strong identification of neurons.",98,"Several markers in the provided list are highly indicative of neuronal cell types.

x-ai/grok-3-mini-beta,Dr. Marie Curie,brain cortex,human,initial,success,90,"The marker set contains several well-established markers for neurons, which are the primary excitatory and inhibitory cells in the human brain cortex responsible for signal transmission. Neurons are typically identified by markers involved in neuronal structure, synaptic function, and neurotransmitter synthesis. From the provided set, the following markers are relevant to neurons:  

- RBFOX3 (also known as NEUN): This is a highly specific nuclear marker for mature neurons, widely used in immunohistochemistry to identify neuronal nuclei. Its presence strongly supports a good match.  
- MAP2: This marker labels microtubules in neuronal dendrites and soma, making it a reliable indicator of neuronal cytoskeletal structure. It adds significant relevance.  
- SYP (Synaptophysin): A presynaptic vesicle protein, SYP is a classic marker for synaptic terminals in neurons, indicating functional neuronal connectivity.  
- TUBB3 (Beta-III tubulin): This is a neuron-specific isoform of tubulin, often used to detect neuronal processes and is particularly abundant in developing and mature neurons.  
- GAD1: This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), a key inhibitory neurotransmitter, and is specific to GABAergic neurons. It enhances the match for inhibitory neuronal subtypes.  
- NEUN: This is identical to RBFOX3 and thus redundant, but it reinforces neuronal specificity.  

These six markers (RBFOX3/NEUN, MAP2, SYP, TUBB3, and GAD1) are highly relevant and provide strong evidence for neuronal identification. However, the set also includes markers not associated with neurons, such as GFAP (astrocytes), IBA1 (microglia), P2RY12 (microglia), S100B (astrocytes), AQP4 (astrocytes), TMEM119 (microglia), OLIG2 (oligodendrocytes), ALDH1L1 (astrocytes), CD45 (immune cells, including microglia), and CX3CR1 (microglia). These non-neuronal markers dilute the overall specificity, as the set appears to be a broad panel rather than neuron-exclusive. Despite this, the presence of multiple high-specificity neuronal markers suggests a strong overall match for neurons in the context of brain cortex cell typing.",85,"Astrocytes are glial cells in the human brain cortex that support neuronal function, maintain the blood-brain barrier, and regulate homeostasis. They are typically marked by proteins involved in structural support and metabolic processes. From the provided marker set, the following markers are relevant to astrocytes:  

- GFAP: This is one of the most specific and widely used markers for astrocytes, particularly for reactive or fibrous astrocytes, as it labels intermediate filaments in their processes. Its inclusion is a strong indicator of a good match.  
- S100B: A calcium-binding protein expressed in astrocytes, it is commonly used to identify these cells, though it can occasionally appear in other glial cells at lower levels. It supports astrocyte identification well.  
- AQP4: Aquaporin 4 is a water channel protein highly expressed on astrocyte endfeet, making it a specific marker for astrocyte interactions with blood vessels and the extracellular space.  
- ALDH1L1: This enzyme is highly specific to astrocytes and is often considered one of the most reliable markers in single-cell analyses, as it is involved in folate metabolism and is predominantly astrocytic.  

These four markers (GFAP, S100B, AQP4, and ALDH1L1) provide solid evidence for astrocyte representation in the set. However, the set also includes several non-astrocyte markers, such as RBFOX3 and NEUN (neurons), IBA1 (microglia), P2RY12 (microglia), TMEM119 (microglia), MAP2 (neurons), SYP (neurons), OLIG2 (oligodendrocytes), CD45 (immune cells), CX3CR1 (microglia), TUBB3 (neurons), and GAD1 (neurons). The presence of these extraneous markers reduces the set's exclusivity for astrocytes, suggesting it is more of a general brain cell panel. Nonetheless, the inclusion of multiple key astrocyte-specific markers indicates a high-quality match overall.",80,"Microglia are the resident immune cells of the human brain cortex, involved in immune surveillance, synaptic pruning, and response to injury. They are identified by markers related to immune function and phagocytosis. From the provided marker set, the following markers are relevant to microglia:  

- IBA1: This calcium-binding protein is a standard marker for microglia and macrophages, labeling their processes and activation states, making it highly relevant.  
- P2RY12: A purinergic receptor specific to microglia in the central nervous system, it is used to distinguish resident microglia from infiltrating macrophages, adding strong specificity.  
- TMEM119: This transmembrane protein is one of the most microglia-specific markers, as it is not expressed in other brain cell types or peripheral immune cells, providing excellent discriminatory power.  
- CD45: A leukocyte common antigen, it is expressed on microglia (though at lower levels than on other immune cells) and can indicate microglial activation; however, its broader expression in hematopoietic cells makes it less specific.  
- CX3CR1: This chemokine receptor is expressed on microglia and is involved in their interaction with neurons, making it a useful but not exclusive marker.  

These five markers (IBA1, P2RY12, TMEM119, CD45, and CX3CR1) demonstrate good coverage for microglia. However, the set includes many non-microglial markers, such as RBFOX3 and NEUN (neurons), GFAP (astrocytes), S100B (astrocytes), MAP2 (neurons), SYP (neurons), AQP4 (astrocytes), OLIG2 (oligodendrocytes), ALDH1L1 (astrocytes), TUBB3 (neurons), and GAD1 (neurons). This mixture indicates that the set is not optimized for microglia alone, potentially leading to cross-contamination in cell type identification. Despite this, the presence of several highly specific microglia markers supports a strong match for this cell type in the brain cortex context.",N/A
