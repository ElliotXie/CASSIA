\arguments{
\item{csv_path}{Path to the CSV file containing cluster annotations}

\item{output_path}{Path to save the results (if NULL, saves back to input CSV file)}

\item{provider}{LLM provider to use ("openai", "anthropic", or "openrouter")}

\item{model}{Specific model to use (if NULL, uses default for provider)}

\item{additional_context}{Optional domain-specific context to help with annotation}

\item{batch_size}{Number of clusters to process in each LLM call}

\item{detail_level}{Level of detail for the groupings: "broad", "detailed", or "very_detailed"}

\item{process_all}{If TRUE, processes all detail levels sequentially}

\item{debug}{If TRUE, print additional debugging information}

\item{api_key}{API key for the provider (if NULL, gets from environment)}

Invisibly returns TRUE if successful

\description{
This function uses large language models to merge and group single-cell RNA-seq cluster annotations
at different levels of granularity. Results are saved directly to a CSV file.
