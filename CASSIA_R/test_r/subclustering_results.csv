1,CD8+ Naive/Early Memory T cells,CD8+ T cells with mucosal/tissue residency potential,"This cluster shows expression of markers associated with naive/early memory T cells (IL7R, CD2, CD6, CD48) and also KLRB1 (CD161), which is often found on mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and some NK-like T cells, but also on a subset of conventional CD8+ T cells. The presence of TRAC indicates it's a conventional T cell receptor. The overall profile suggests a less differentiated state with some potential for tissue residency or specific homing."
2,CD8+ Exhausted T cells,CD8+ T cells with NK-like features/Tissue-resident memory T cells,"This cluster is characterized by markers associated with exhaustion and activation (HAVCR2, TIGIT, TNFRSF9, ENTPD1) and also NK cell receptors (KLRC2, KLRC3). LAYN is a marker often associated with tissue-resident memory T cells and exhausted T cells. The presence of TRDC suggests potential gamma-delta T cell contamination or a subset of alpha-beta T cells expressing gamma-delta markers, although given the parent cluster is CD8, it's more likely a subset within the CD8 lineage with some unconventional features or a mixed population."
3,CD8+ Effector Memory T cells,CD8+ Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs),"This cluster exhibits markers of effector function (GZMK, GZMH, PRF1, NKG7, CST7) and terminal differentiation (KLRG1, EOMES). The co-expression of CCR7 and CD28 suggests a central memory or effector memory phenotype, while the presence of HLA-DR indicates activation. This profile is consistent with cytotoxic effector T cells, potentially with some memory characteristics."
4,Epithelial cell contamination,Unconventional CD8+ T cell subset (less likely),"This cluster expresses markers typically associated with epithelial cells and developmental processes (CDX2, HOXD13, CA12, CEACAM7, WFDC2, AGR2, MUC4). These markers are highly unusual for T cells and strongly suggest contamination from epithelial cells or a very rare, unconventional T cell subset with epithelial-like characteristics, which is less likely in a standard T cell isolation. Given the strong epithelial signature, contamination is the most probable explanation."
5,CD8+ T cells with NK-like features,NK cell contamination,"This cluster shows expression of markers associated with NK cells and innate lymphoid cells (ITGAX, TYROBP, FCER1G, GNLY, KLRF1, KIR2DL4). The presence of CD38 and HAVCR2 can indicate activation or exhaustion. While some CD8+ T cells can acquire NK-like features, the strong presence of multiple NK-associated markers suggests either a population of NK-like CD8+ T cells or contamination from NK cells."
6,Mesenchymal/Stromal cell contamination,Unconventional CD8+ T cell subset (less likely),"This cluster expresses markers associated with mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts, and developmental processes (LPL, SNAI2, FGF2, SPP1, SOX2, NES, PDGFRA, SPARC, TCF4). These markers are not typical for T cells and strongly suggest contamination from stromal or mesenchymal cells. Similar to cluster 4, contamination is the most likely explanation."
