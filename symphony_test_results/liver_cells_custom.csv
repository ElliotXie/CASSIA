google/gemini-2.5-flash,Dr. Ada Lovelace,liver,human,initial,success,95,"The markers provided exhibit a strong match for hepatocytes.
**ALB (Albumin):** This is a highly specific and abundant gene expressed by mature hepatocytes. Albumin synthesis and secretion are primary functions of the liver, and hepatocytes are the main cell type responsible for this. Therefore, ALB expression is a strong indicator of hepatocyte presence and function.
**CYP3A4 (Cytochrome P450 Family 3 Subfamily A Member 4):** CYP3A4 is one of the most important drug-metabolizing enzymes in the human liver. It is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes and plays a crucial role in the biotransformation of a vast array of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. Its high expression in the liver is largely attributed to hepatocyte activity, making it an excellent marker for these cells.
**CD163 and MARCO:** These markers are not typically expressed by hepatocytes. CD163 is a scavenger receptor predominantly expressed on monocytes and macrophages, including Kupffer cells in the liver. MARCO (Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous Structure) is also a scavenger receptor expressed on macrophages, particularly marginal zone macrophages and some Kupffer cells. Their presence in the overall marker set, while negative for hepatocytes, helps to differentiate hepatocytes from other liver cell types, particularly the macrophages. The absence of these macrophage-specific markers in a cell that expresses ALB and CYP3A4 further strengthens the likelihood that the cells are hepatocytes.",85,"The markers provided offer a good, but not perfect, match for Kupffer cells, which are the resident macrophages of the liver.
**CD163 (Scavenger Receptor Cysteine-Rich Domain Family M Member 1):** CD163 is a widely accepted and highly expressed marker for mature macrophages, including Kupffer cells in the human liver. Its expression indicates the presence of cells from the monocyte-macrophage lineage.
**MARCO (Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous Structure):** MARCO is another scavenger receptor expressed by certain populations of macrophages, including some Kupffer cells. Its presence further supports the identification of cells as macrophages. While not as universally expressed as CD163 across all Kupffer cell subsets, it is a significant indicator.
**ALB (Albumin) and CYP3A4 (Cytochrome P450 Family 3 Subfamily A Member 4):** These markers are overwhelmingly expressed by hepatocytes and are fundamentally absent or expressed at negligible levels in Kupffer cells. The *absence* of these hepatocyte-specific markers, in conjunction with the presence of macrophage-specific markers (CD163, MARCO), is crucial for positively identifying Kupffer cells and distinguishing them from the dominant hepatocyte population. If these markers were present, it would indicate significant cellular contamination or a misidentification. Their absence, therefore, strengthens the confidence in identifying Kupffer cells based on the other markers.",N/A
anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku,Researcher_claude-3.5-haiku,liver,human,initial,success,85,"- ALB (Albumin): Extremely specific and highly characteristic marker for hepatocytes. Albumin is primarily produced by hepatocytes and is a gold standard marker for hepatic parenchymal cells.
- CYP3A4 (Cytochrome P450 3A4): A key hepatic enzyme predominantly expressed in hepatocytes, involved in drug metabolism. Strongly indicative of hepatocyte-specific functionality.
- CD163 and MARCO: Not typically associated with hepatocytes, slightly reducing the specificity of the marker set for this cell type.

The presence of two strong hepatocyte-specific markers (ALB and CYP3A4) provides robust evidence for identifying hepatocytes.",90,"- CD163: An excellent marker for Kupffer cells (resident liver macrophages). Highly specific and widely used to identify these immune cells in the liver.
- MARCO (Macrophage Scavenger Receptor): Another strong marker for macrophages, particularly supportive of Kupffer cell identification.
- ALB and CYP3A4: Not relevant for Kupffer cell identification, as these are hepatocyte-specific markers.

The presence of two robust macrophage/Kupffer cell markers (CD163 and MARCO) provides strong support for identifying Kupffer cells.",N/A
