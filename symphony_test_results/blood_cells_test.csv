google/gemini-2.5-flash,Dr. Ada Lovelace,peripheral blood,human,initial,success,95,"The marker set includes several key markers for T cells. CD3 is a pan-T cell marker, meaning it is expressed on virtually all T cells. The presence of CD4 and CD8 allows for the differentiation of T helper cells (CD3+CD4+) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD3+CD8+), which are major subsets of T cells. The absence of CD19, CD20 (B cell markers), CD14, and CD16 (monocyte/NK cell markers) further supports the identification of T cells and excludes contamination from other major leukocyte populations. The combination of CD3, CD4, and CD8 provides a strong and specific signature for T cells.",90,"The marker set contains two highly specific markers for B cells: CD19 and CD20. CD19 is a pan-B cell marker, expressed throughout B cell development from pro-B cells to mature B cells, before down-regulation on plasma cells. CD20 is also widely expressed on B lymphocytes from pre-B cells to activated B cells but is lost on plasma cells. The absence of CD3, CD4, CD8 (T cell markers), CD14, and CD16 (myeloid/NK cell markers) helps to exclude other major cell types. The co-expression of CD19 and CD20 is a definitive signature for mature B cells in peripheral blood.",90,"The marker set includes CD14 and CD16, which are critical for identifying and differentiating monocyte subsets. CD14 is expressed at high levels on classical monocytes (CD14++CD16-), while CD16 is expressed on non-classical monocytes (CD14+CD16++) and intermediate monocytes (CD14++CD16+). The co-expression patterns of CD14 and CD16 are essential for distinguishing these monocyte populations. The absence of CD3, CD4, CD8 (T cell markers), CD19, and CD20 (B cell markers) further confirms the identity of these cells as monocytes and not lymphocytes. This marker set is very good for identifying the main monocyte subsets found in peripheral blood.",N/A
x-ai/grok-3-mini-beta,Dr. Marie Curie,peripheral blood,human,initial,success,85,"The marker set includes several markers directly relevant to T cells, which are a major lymphocyte population in human peripheral blood. CD3 is a pan-T cell marker, essential for T cell receptor signaling and identity, making it highly relevant for identifying T cells. CD4 and CD8, which follow in the ranked set, are also critical as they distinguish T cell subsets: CD4 for helper T cells and CD8 for cytotoxic T cells. The presence of these three markers (CD3, CD4, and CD8) provides a strong foundation for T cell identification, allowing for comprehensive subset analysis.  

However, the set also includes markers not relevant to T cells, which could dilute its specificity for this cell type. For instance, CD19 and CD20 are B cell-specific markers, used for B cell lineage identification, and have no role in T cell biology. CD14 is primarily a monocyte marker, associated with myeloid cells, and CD16 is found on monocytes, neutrophils, and some natural killer cells, making it irrelevant for T cells. The inclusion of these non-T cell markers suggests the set is broader than necessary for T cell analysis, potentially leading to cross-contamination in identification if not carefully gated.  

Overall, the set matches well for T cells due to the inclusion of core markers (CD3, CD4, CD8), but the presence of irrelevant markers reduces its precision as a dedicated T cell panel. This reflects a good but not perfect match, as the relevant markers cover the primary aspects of T cell identification while the extras introduce noise.",80,"For B cells, which are key players in adaptive immunity in human peripheral blood, the marker set includes two highly relevant markers: CD19 and CD20. These are standard B cell markersâ€”CD19 is involved in B cell receptor signaling and is expressed throughout B cell development, while CD20 is a surface protein used for B cell enumeration and therapeutic targeting. Their presence in the set allows for accurate identification of B cells, making this a strong match for basic B cell analysis.  

The set's other markers are largely irrelevant to B cells. CD3, CD4, and CD8 are T cell-specific, with CD3 being a hallmark of T cell lineage and CD4/CD8 distinguishing T cell subsets; these do not apply to B cells and could complicate analysis if the set is used without proper gating. CD14 is a monocyte marker associated with pattern recognition and phagocytosis, and CD16, while present on some immune cells, is not characteristic of B cells (it's more relevant to monocytes and natural killer cells). The inclusion of these non-B cell markers indicates that the set is not optimized exclusively for B cells, potentially reducing its utility in a focused B cell study.  

In summary, the set performs well for B cells due to the inclusion of CD19 and CD20, which are sufficient for primary identification, but the irrelevant markers lower the overall specificity. This results in a good match quality, though not ideal for exclusive B cell profiling.",75,"Monocytes, as myeloid cells in human peripheral blood, are well-represented in this marker set by CD14 and CD16. CD14 is a primary marker for monocytes, involved in innate immune responses and Toll-like receptor signaling, making it essential for monocyte identification. CD16, which is expressed on a subset of monocytes (e.g., non-classical monocytes), adds value by allowing for subset differentiation based on function and activation state. The inclusion of these two markers provides a solid basis for monocyte detection and characterization.  

The remaining markers in the set are not relevant to monocytes and could interfere with analysis. CD3 is a T cell marker, CD4 marks helper T cells (and some monocytes in rare contexts, but not primarily), and CD8 is specific to cytotoxic T cells, all of which belong to the lymphoid lineage and have no direct role in monocyte biology. Similarly, CD19 and CD20 are B cell markers, associated with lymphoid development, and are irrelevant here. The presence of these lymphoid markers suggests the set is designed for a broader leukocyte panel rather than monocyte-specific analysis, which might require additional gating to isolate monocytes accurately.  

Overall, the set matches effectively for monocytes due to the key markers CD14 and CD16, but the inclusion of unrelated markers reduces its focus and precision. This leads to a strong but not perfect match for monocyte identification.",N/A
deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324,Dr. Alan Turing,peripheral blood,human,initial,success,95,"T cells are best identified by the presence of **CD3**, a pan-T cell marker, which is highly specific for this cell type. Additionally, **CD4** and **CD8** are lineage markers for helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, respectively, further refining the identification. The absence of **CD19**, **CD20** (B cell markers), and **CD14**, **CD16** (myeloid/monocyte markers) strengthens the specificity for T cells. The combination of CD3 with either CD4 or CD8 provides a robust match.",90,"B cells are primarily marked by **CD19** and **CD20**, both of which are highly specific for this lineage. The lack of **CD3** (T cell marker) and **CD14/CD16** (monocyte markers) supports the identification. However, the absence of additional B cell markers like **CD22** or **CD79a** might slightly reduce confidence, though CD19 and CD20 are sufficient for a strong match.",85,"Monocytes are classically identified by **CD14**, a key marker for classical monocytes, and **CD16**, which is expressed on non-classical monocytes. However, the marker set lacks **CD64** (another monocyte marker), which could improve specificity. The absence of **CD3** (T cell) and **CD19/CD20** (B cell) helps rule out lymphoid contamination. While CD14/CD16 are sufficient for identification, the score is slightly lower because some monocytes may express only CD14 or CD16, necessitating additional markers for comprehensive coverage.",N/A
