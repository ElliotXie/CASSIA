google/gemini-2.5-flash,Dr. Ada Lovelace,brain cortex,human,initial,success,85,"The marker set includes several markers, and their relevance to neurons needs to be carefully evaluated.
*   **RBFOX3 (NeuN):** This is the strongest positive marker for neurons in this set. RBFOX3 (also known as NeuN) is a widely accepted and highly specific pan-neuronal nuclear marker. Its presence is a strong indicator of neuronal identity.
*   **GFAP, S100B, IBA1, CX3CR1, CD45:** These markers are generally not expressed by healthy mature neurons.
*   **GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein):** Exclusively expressed by astrocytes. Its presence would argue against neuronal identity.
*   **S100B (S100 Calcium Binding Protein B):** Primarily expressed by astrocytes and some oligodendrocytes; not typically found in neurons.
*   **IBA1 (Ionized Calcium-Binding Adapter Molecule 1):** A specific marker for microglia/macrophages. Its presence would argue against neuronal identity.
*   **CX3CR1 (CX3C Chemokine Receptor 1):** Primarily expressed by microglia. Its presence would argue against neuronal identity.
*   **CD45 (Leukocyte Common Antigen):** A pan-leukocyte marker, including microglia, but not expressed by neurons.

Given that RBFOX3 is a strong and specific positive marker for neurons, its presence alone provides a good match. The other markers, while highly specific for non-neuronal cells, effectively act as negative markers for neurons. The ideal neuronal marker set would primarily consist of high-specificity positive neuronal markers, but the inclusion of RBFOX3 is sufficient to identify neurons.",95,"The marker set contains key positive markers for astrocytes, along with markers for other cell types which serve as negative indicators for astrocytes.
*   **GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein):** This is a canonical and highly specific marker for astrocytes in the human brain, particularly reactive astrocytes, but also some mature astrocytes. Its strong presence is a primary indicator of astrocytic identity.
*   **S100B (S100 Calcium Binding Protein B):** Another well-established marker for astrocytes (and also some oligodendrocytes), providing good corroboration for GFAP expression.
*   **RBFOX3 (NeuN):** This is a pan-neuronal marker and would be absent in astrocytes. Its absence helps to rule out neurons.
*   **IBA1 (Ionized Calcium-Binding Adapter Molecule 1):** A specific microglial marker, absent in astrocytes.
*   **CX3CR1 (CX3C Chemokine Receptor 1):** Primarily expressed by microglia, absent in astrocytes.
*   **CD45 (Leukocyte Common Antigen):** A pan-leukocyte marker (including microglia, lymphocytes), absent in astrocytes.

The presence of both GFAP and S100B provides a robust positive identification for astrocytes. The absence of neuronal and microglial markers further strengthens the specificity.",98,"The marker set includes several highly specific and complementary markers for microglia.
*   **IBA1 (Ionized Calcium-Binding Adapter Molecule 1):** This is a widely used and highly specific marker for microglia (and macrophages) in the brain. Its robust expression is a definitive indicator of microglial identity.
*   **CX3CR1 (CX3C Chemokine Receptor 1):** While not exclusively microglial (some neurons express it at lower levels), in the context of other markers, it is highly characteristic of microglia in the CNS. Its expression confirms microglial identity.
*   **CD45 (Leukocyte Common Antigen):** Microglia are considered part of the circulating leukocyte lineage, and CD45 is expressed by all leukocytes. In the brain, high CD45 expression combined with other microglial markers is characteristic, especially for activated microglia, whereas resting microglia typically express intermediate levels of CD45. Its presence, along with IBA1 and CX3CR1, further supports microglial identity and helps distinguish them from astrocytes and neurons.
*   **RBFOX3 (NeuN):** This is a neuronal marker and would be absent in microglia. Its absence rules out neurons.
*   **GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein):** A specific astrocyte marker, absent in microglia.
*   **S100B (S100 Calcium Binding Protein B):** Primarily an astrocyte marker, absent in microglia.

The combination of IBA1, CX3CR1, and CD45 provides a highly accurate and comprehensive signature for identifying microglia, effectively distinguishing them from other major brain cell types.",N/A
x-ai/grok-3-mini-beta,Dr. Marie Curie,brain cortex,human,initial,success,20,"For neurons in the human brain cortex, the marker set includes RBFOX3, which is highly relevant as it is a well-established marker for mature neurons (e.g., NeuN is used to label neuronal nuclei and is specific to excitatory and inhibitory neurons). However, the other markers show poor relevance: GFAP and S100B are associated with astrocytes and not neurons, making them irrelevant; IBA1 is specific to microglia, further distancing the set from neurons; CX3CR1 is expressed on microglia and immune cells, with no significant neuronal association; and CD45, a leukocyte marker, is occasionally seen in neuronal contexts under pathological conditions like inflammation, but it is not a standard neuronal marker. Overall, only one marker (RBFOX3) aligns with neurons, indicating a weak match for the set as a whole, as it lacks complementary neuronal markers (e.g., MAP2 or SYNAPSIN) and includes markers for other cell types, which could lead to confusion in identification.",45,"For astrocytes in the human brain cortex, the marker set includes GFAP and S100B, both of which are highly relevant and commonly used markers for astrocytes. GFAP is a primary intermediate filament protein in astrocytes, making it essential for their identification, especially in reactive states, while S100B is another reliable marker involved in astrocyte function and often co-expressed with GFAP. These two markers provide strong support for astrocytes. However, the other markers are largely irrelevant: RBFOX3 is specific to neurons and has no known association with astrocytes; IBA1 is a microglial marker, offering no match; CX3CR1 is primarily on microglia and immune cells, with minimal overlap; and CD45, while sometimes expressed in astrocytes during inflammation, is not a standard astrocyte marker and is more indicative of immune activation. Thus, two out of six markers (GFAP and S100B) are directly relevant, suggesting a moderate match, but the presence of non-astrocyte markers dilutes the set's specificity for astrocytes alone.",65,"For microglia in the human brain cortex, the marker set includes IBA1, CX3CR1, and CD45, all of which are relevant to varying degrees. IBA1 is a highly specific and widely used marker for microglia, indicating their activation and morphological changes; CX3CR1 is another strong marker, as it is expressed on microglia and plays a role in their interaction with neurons via fractalkine signaling; and CD45, while not exclusive to microglia (as it marks other leukocytes), is relevant in the brain context as it helps identify microglial immune functions. These three markers provide substantial support for microglia identification. In contrast, the other markers are not relevant: RBFOX3 is specific to neurons and has no microglial association; GFAP and S100B are astrocyte markers with no overlap. With three out of six markers directly aligning with microglia, the set shows a good match, though the inclusion of non-microglial markers reduces its precision for exclusive microglial profiling.",N/A
deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324,Dr. Alan Turing,brain cortex,human,initial,success,80,"- **RBFOX3 (NeuN)**: A highly specific nuclear marker for mature neurons, strongly indicative of neuronal identity.  
- **GFAP, S100B**: Primarily astrocytic markers; their presence does not support neuronal identity.  
- **IBA1, CX3CR1, CD45**: Microglia/macrophage markers; irrelevant to neurons.  
Only **RBFOX3** is neuron-specific in this set, while other markers are either absent or conflicting. The lack of additional neuronal markers (e.g., *MAP2*, *SYN1*) limits the confidence in a comprehensive neuronal profile.",85,"- **GFAP**: A canonical intermediate filament marker for astrocytes (though not exclusive, as itâ€™s also in some progenitors).  
- **S100B**: A calcium-binding protein highly expressed in astrocytes, supporting the match.  
- **RBFOX3**: Absent in astrocytes (neuronal marker), reducing specificity.  
- **IBA1, CX3CR1, CD45**: Microglial markers; irrelevant to astrocytes.  
The presence of **GFAP** and **S100B** provides strong support, but the lack of additional astrocyte markers (e.g., *ALDH1L1*, *AQP4*) prevents a perfect score.",90,"- **IBA1**: A key cytoskeletal marker for microglia (and macrophages).  
- **CX3CR1**: A chemokine receptor specific to microglia in the brain parenchyma.  
- **CD45 (PTPRC)**: Expressed in microglia (higher than neurons/astrocytes), though not exclusive.  
- **GFAP, S100B, RBFOX3**: Absent in microglia; their presence would contradict the identity.  
The combination of **IBA1 + CX3CR1** is highly specific, and **CD45** adds support. However, **CX3CR1** can also label peripheral macrophages, and the lack of *TMEM119* (microglia-specific) prevents a perfect score.",N/A
