List the Key Functional Markers:** This list is rich in genes associated with cytotoxic function and immune activation. * **Cytotoxicity & Granule-associated:** * **KLRC2, KLRK1, KLRC4, KLRD1 (NKG2 family, CD94):** These are C-type lectin-like receptors expressed on NK cells and some T cells. They play roles in target cell recognition and activation/inhibition of cytotoxicity. KLRD1 (CD94) forms a heterodimer with NKG2A, C, or E. * **GZMH, GZMA, GZMB, GZMK (Granzymes):** Serine proteases stored in cytotoxic granules, crucial for inducing apoptosis in target cells. GZMB is a potent inducer of apoptosis. * **NKG7:** A transmembrane protein found in cytotoxic granules of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), involved in granule exocytosis. * **PRF1 (Perforin 1):** A pore-forming protein essential for the delivery of granzymes into target cells, leading to their lysis. * **CTSW (Cathepsin W):** A cysteine protease expressed in NK cells and CTLs, potentially involved in granule maturation or function. * **GZMM:** Another granzyme, often co-expressed with other granzymes. * **CST7 (Cystatin F):** A cysteine protease inhibitor, potentially regulating intracellular protease activity in immune cells. * **Chemokines & Chemokine Receptors:** * **XCL2, XCL1 (XCL1/2, Lymphotactin):** Chemokines that primarily attract T cells and NK cells. * **CCL4, CCL4L2 (MIP-1β, MIP-1βL):** Chemokines that attract various immune cells, including NK cells, T cells, and monocytes. * **CCL5 (RANTES):** A chemokine that attracts T cells, eosinophils, and basophils. * **GPR18:** A G protein-coupled receptor, potentially involved in immune cell trafficking or activation. * **Cytokines & Cytokine Receptors:** * **IL21R:** Receptor for Interleukin-21, a cytokine important for NK cell and T cell development and function. * **IFNG (Interferon-gamma):** A potent pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by NK cells and T cells, crucial for antiviral and anti-tumor immunity. * **TNFRSF9 (CD137/4-1BB):** A co-stimulatory receptor expressed on activated T cells and NK cells, promoting their survival and proliferation. * **Immune Checkpoints & Co-stimulatory Molecules:** * **TIGIT:** An inhibitory receptor expressed on NK cells and T cells, involved in immune evasion. * **LAG3 (Lymphocyte-activation gene 3):** An inhibitory receptor expressed on activated T cells and NK cells, contributing to immune exhaustion. * **CD160:** A receptor expressed on NK cells and some T cells, with both activating and inhibitory functions depending on the context. **Step 2. List the Key Cell Type Markers:** This list strongly points towards cytotoxic lymphocytes. * **T-cell Lineage Markers:** * **CD8B, CD8A:** Components of the CD8 co-receptor, characteristic of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). * **TRGC2, TRGC1:** Components of the T-cell receptor gamma chain, indicating gamma-delta T cells. * **CD7:** A pan-T cell marker, also found on NK cells. * **PTPN22:** A phosphatase involved in T cell signaling, mutations associated with autoimmunity. * **SH2D1A (SAP):** An adaptor protein crucial for signaling in NK cells and T cells, particularly NKT cells. * **IKZF2 (Helios):** A transcription factor expressed in regulatory T cells and some activated effector T cells. * **NK Cell Lineage Markers:** * **KLRC2, KLRK1, KLRC4, KLRD1:** As mentioned above, these are highly characteristic of NK cells (and some NKT/T cells). * **NKG7:** Strongly associated with NK cells and CTLs. * **CD160:** Expressed on NK cells and some T cells. * **XCL1, XCL2:** Often associated with NK cell activity. * **General Lymphocyte/Immune Markers:** * **CRTAM:** A cell adhesion molecule expressed on NK cells and some T cells, involved in cell-cell interactions. * **ENTPD1 (CD39):** An ectonucleotidase expressed on various immune cells, including regulatory T cells and some effector T cells, involved in ATP/adenosine metabolism. * **ABI3:** An adaptor protein involved in actin dynamics and immune cell signaling. * **HOPX:** A homeobox protein, its role in immune cells is less defined but has been observed in some T cell subsets. * **ZEB2:** A transcription factor involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, but also plays roles in immune cell development and function, particularly in NK cells and T cells. * **LAYN:** A hyaluronan-binding protein, expressed on some immune cells, including regulatory T cells. * **AOAH:** Acyl-CoA hydrolase, involved in lipid metabolism, its specific role in immune cell identity is less direct but can be differentially expressed. **Step 3. Cross-reference Known Databases:** A rapid mental or actual search of common scRNA-seq databases (e.g., Human Cell Atlas, PanglaoDB, CellMarker, Azimuth) for these markers consistently points to cytotoxic lymphocytes. * **CD8A, CD8B, GZMA, GZMB, PRF1, NKG7, IFNG, CCL5:** These are canonical markers for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). * **KLRC2, KLRK1, KLRD1, XCL1, XCL2, GZMH, CD160:** These are highly characteristic of Natural Killer (NK) cells. * **TRGC1, TRGC2:** These are definitive markers for gamma-delta T cells. The co-expression of these markers is key. The presence of both CD8 markers and NK cell-specific KLRs, along with gamma-delta TCR components, suggests a mixed or overlapping population, or a specific subset that shares characteristics. **Step 4. Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type:** Based on the overwhelming presence of cytotoxic granule components (granzymes, perforin, NKG7), cytotoxic receptors (KLRs), chemokines associated with lymphocyte recruitment, and key T cell (CD8A/B, TRGC1/2) and NK cell markers, the most probable general cell type is **Cytotoxic Lymphocytes**. **Step 5. Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types:** 1. **Most Likely: CD8+ Effector/Cytotoxic T Cells (CTLs) with NK-like features or NKT-like cells.** * **Reasoning:** The strong expression of `CD8A`, `CD8B`, `GZMA`, `GZMB`, `GZMK`, `PRF1`, `NKG7`, `IFNG`, `CCL5`, `TNFRSF9`, `TIGIT`, and `LAG3` are all hallmarks of activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. The co-expression of NK cell-associated markers like `KLRC2`, `KLRK1`, `KLRC4`, `KLRD1`, `XCL1`, `XCL2`, `GZMH`, and `CD160` is particularly interesting. This pattern is often observed in highly activated effector CD8+ T cells that acquire NK-like functions (sometimes termed ""NK-like T cells"" or ""effector memory T cells re-expressing NK receptors"") or in NKT cells, especially Type I NKT cells, which express an invariant TCR and NK cell markers. Given the large intestine context, tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) can also exhibit these cytotoxic and NK-like features. The presence of `TRGC1` and `TRGC2` also suggests a potential contribution from gamma-delta T cells, which are abundant in the gut and often exhibit cytotoxic functions and express NK receptors. 2. **Second Most Likely: Natural Killer (NK) Cells.** * **Reasoning:** The high expression of `KLRC2`, `XCL2`, `CRTAM`, `KLRK1`, `KLRC4`, `KLRD1`, `XCL1`, `GZMH`, `CD160`, `NKG7`, `GZMA`, `GZMB`, `GZMK`, `PRF1`, `CCL4`, `CCL5`, `IFNG`, `TIGIT`, `LAG3` are all characteristic of NK cells. While `CD8A` and `CD8B` are typically T cell markers, a small subset of NK cells can express low levels of CD8 (especially CD8αα homodimer), particularly in certain tissues or activation states. However, the strong presence of both CD8A/B and gamma-delta TCR components makes pure NK cells less likely than a T cell subset with NK features. 3. **Third Most Likely: Gamma-Delta (γδ) T Cells.** * **Reasoning:** The definitive markers `TRGC2` and `TRGC1` are strong indicators of gamma-delta T cells. These cells are abundant in mucosal tissues like the large intestine, often exhibit potent cytotoxic functions, and can express NK cell receptors (e.g., NKG2D, CD160) and granzymes. They also contribute to IFN-gamma production. The co-expression of CD8A/B is also possible for certain γδ T cell subsets. The overall cytotoxic profile fits well with γδ T cell function. **Most Likely Subtype:** Considering the strong co-expression of `CD8A/B` with multiple `granzymes`, `perforin`, `NKG7`, `IFNG`, and a broad array of `KLR` family members (typically associated with NK cells but also found on activated T cells), along with `TRGC1/2`, the most likely subtype is **CD8+ Effector/Cytotoxic T Cells with NK-like features, potentially including a significant proportion of Gamma-Delta T cells.** This population represents highly activated, tissue-resident cytotoxic lymphocytes that are crucial for immune surveillance in the large intestine. The presence of both alpha-beta (implied by CD8A/B) and gamma-delta TCR components suggests either a mixed population or a highly plastic and functionally diverse group of cytotoxic T cells. Given the ranking, the CD8+ and NK-like features are very prominent. **Step 6. Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis:** This cell cluster from the human large intestine is characterized by a robust expression profile of genes associated with **cytotoxic lymphocyte function**. Key markers include high levels of **granzymes (GZMH, GZMA, GZMB, GZMK, GZMM), perforin (PRF1), and NKG7**, indicating potent cytolytic activity. The presence of **CD8A and CD8B** strongly points towards a **CD8+ T cell lineage**. Concurrently, there is significant expression of **NK cell-associated receptors (KLRC2, KLRK1, KLRC4, KLRD1, CD160)** and **chemokines (XCL1, XCL2, CCL4, CCL5)**, suggesting these T cells have acquired NK-like effector functions or represent a subset with shared characteristics. Furthermore, the detection of **TRGC1 and TRGC2** indicates the involvement of **gamma-delta T cells**, which are known to be abundant in the gut and often exhibit cytotoxic and NK-like properties. Immune checkpoint molecules like **TIGIT and LAG3** suggest an activated or potentially exhausted state. Therefore, the most probable general cell type is **Cytotoxic Lymphocytes**. The top three most probable sub-cell types are: 1. **CD8+ Effector/Cytotoxic T Cells with NK-like features (including potential NKT-like cells).** 2. **Natural Killer (NK) Cells.** 3. **Gamma-Delta (γδ) T Cells.** The most likely specific annotation for this cluster is **CD8+ Effector/Cytotoxic T Cells with NK-like features, potentially encompassing a significant gamma-delta T cell component**, representing a highly activated and functionally diverse population of cytotoxic lymphocytes crucial for immune defense in the large intestine.

intestinal crypt stem cell,Intestinal Stem Cells (ISCs),"LGR5+ Crypt Base Columnar (CBC) Stem Cells, Secretory-biased Intestinal Stem Cells, Wnt-activated Intestinal Stem Cells",,50,"AL031284.1, AC012085.1, IGFBPL1, HMGN2P6, CHCHD2P9, PPIAP40, LGR5, RPL7P54, AC010132.3, EIF5AP4, AC008694.2, COX5AP2, TDGF1, ASCL2, AC092670.1, NPM1P6, PPIAP11, AC090498.1, RPL41P1, CYCSP55, HMGN2P4, TPI1P1, RPL41P5, AL162151.2, PPIAP29, HNRNPA1P4, AC016596.2, AL603825.1, RPL9P21, AC005884.2, PPIAP31, HMGN1P36, HMGN2P41, AL035411.1, RPS26P39, FABP5P7, SDHDP6, ATP5PFP1, EEF1A1P5, RPSAP8, HMGN2P3, SLC39A2, KRT8P13, RPL21P16, RPSAP15, HMGN1P38, AF279873.1, RPL7P6, AC112491.1, AC022968.1",1,google/gemini-2.5-flash,openrouter,large intestine,human,N/A,"Final Annotation Agent: Here's a detailed analysis to identify the cell type based on the provided marker list: **Step 1. List the Key Functional Markers:** The provided list contains a mix of protein-coding genes, pseudogenes, and uncharacterized loci. For functional analysis, we will focus on the protein-coding genes. * **IGFBPL1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-Like 1):** While its exact function is still under investigation, IGFBPs generally modulate the activity of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), which are crucial for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. IGFBPL1 has been implicated in various biological processes, including cell growth and migration, and may play a role in stem cell maintenance or differentiation. * **LGR5 (Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5):** This is a well-established and highly specific marker for actively cycling adult stem cells in various tissues, including the intestine. LGR5+ cells are known to be multipotent and responsible for tissue regeneration and homeostasis. Its high expression here is a very strong indicator. * **TDGF1 (Teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor 1) / Cripto-1:** A member of the epidermal growth factor-CFC (EGF-CFC) family, TDGF1 is a co-receptor for Nodal and Activin signaling pathways, which are critical for embryonic development and stem cell maintenance. It promotes cell proliferation and survival and is often associated with pluripotent stem cells and cancer stem cells. * **ASCL2 (Achaete-scute homolog 2):** A basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, ASCL2 is a key regulator of intestinal stem cell maintenance and proliferation. It works in conjunction with Wnt signaling to promote the stem cell phenotype and inhibit differentiation. Its expression is highly restricted to intestinal stem cells. * **SLC39A2 (Solute Carrier Family 39 Member 2) / ZIP2:** This gene encodes a zinc transporter. Zinc is an essential trace element involved in numerous cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and immune function. While not a specific stem cell marker, its expression can be relevant to the metabolic activity and maintenance of rapidly dividing cells. **Step 2. List the Key Cell Type Markers:** Again, focusing on protein-coding genes with known cell type specificity. * **LGR5:** As mentioned above, LGR5 is the quintessential marker for intestinal stem cells (ISCs) located at the crypt base. Its presence at the top of the ranked list is highly significant. * **ASCL2:** Also a definitive marker for intestinal stem cells, working synergistically with LGR5 in maintaining the stem cell niche. * **TDGF1:** While not exclusively an intestinal stem cell marker, its role in stem cell maintenance and its co-expression with LGR5 and ASCL2 in the intestine further supports a stem cell identity. The remaining protein-coding genes (IGFBPL1, SLC39A2) are more broadly involved in cellular processes or growth regulation and do not strongly point to a specific differentiated cell type on their own, but rather support a proliferative or stem-like state. Many of the other entries are pseudogenes (e.g., HMGN2P6, PPIAP40, RPL7P54, EIF5AP4, NPM1P6, PPIAP11, RPL41P1, CYCSP55, HMGN2P4, TPI1P1, RPL41P5, PPIAP29, HNRNPA1P4, RPL9P21, PPIAP31, HMGN1P36, HMGN2P41, RPS26P39, FABP5P7, SDHDP6, ATP5PFP1, EEF1A1P5, RPSAP8, HMGN2P3, KRT8P13, RPL21P16, RPSAP15, HMGN1P38, RPL7P6) or uncharacterized loci (e.g., AL031284.1, AC012085.1, AC010132.3, AC008694.2, AC092670.1, AC090498.1, AL162151.2, AC016596.2, AL603825.1, AC005884.2, AL035411.1, AF279873.1, AC112491.1, AC022968.1). Pseudogenes are generally not used for cell type identification as they are typically non-functional or have very low and non-specific expression. **Step 3. Cross-reference Known Databases:** * **LGR5:** Widely recognized in scRNA-seq databases (e.g., Human Cell Atlas, various intestinal scRNA-seq datasets) as the primary marker for intestinal stem cells. Its expression is highly enriched in crypt base columnar (CBC) cells. * **ASCL2:** Consistently found to be co-expressed with LGR5 in intestinal stem cells across numerous studies. It's a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway's regulation of stemness. * **TDGF1:** While also found in embryonic stem cells and some cancers, its presence in the adult intestine, particularly in conjunction with LGR5 and ASCL2, supports a role in the stem cell niche. Some studies have shown its expression in intestinal crypts. * **IGFBPL1:** Less consistently reported as a *definitive* stem cell marker, but its expression has been noted in various stem cell populations and is often associated with proliferative states. The strong co-expression of LGR5 and ASCL2, both at high ranks, is a hallmark signature of intestinal stem cells. **Step 4. Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type:** Based on the overwhelming evidence from the key markers, particularly the high expression of **LGR5** and **ASCL2**, the most probable general cell type is **Intestinal Stem Cells (ISCs)**. These cells are responsible for the continuous renewal of the intestinal epithelium. **Step 5. Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types:** Within the general category of Intestinal Stem Cells, there are nuances and different states. 1. **Most Likely: LGR5+ Crypt Base Columnar (CBC) Stem Cells:** * **Reasoning:** The presence of LGR5 as a top marker is the defining characteristic of these cells. ASCL2 is also a critical transcription factor for their maintenance and function. These cells are the primary, actively cycling stem cells responsible for generating all other epithelial lineages in the small intestine and colon. The large intestine tissue context further supports this. TDGF1 and IGFBPL1 can be associated with their proliferative and developmental potential. 2. **Second Most Likely: Secretory-biased Intestinal Stem Cells (or early secretory progenitors):** * **Reasoning:** While LGR5+ CBCs are multipotent, some studies suggest a subtle bias or transitional states. If there were additional markers for secretory lineage commitment (e.g., *Neurog3* for enteroendocrine, *Spdef* for Paneth/Goblet), this would be more strongly supported. However, LGR5+ cells *give rise* to secretory cells, and some LGR5+ cells might be in a state of early commitment. Without specific secretory lineage markers, this is a less direct inference but still plausible given the stem cell identity. 3. **Third Most Likely: Wnt-activated Intestinal Stem Cells:** * **Reasoning:** LGR5 is a direct transcriptional target of Wnt signaling, and ASCL2 is also a key mediator of Wnt-driven stemness. The high expression of these markers strongly implies active Wnt signaling in these cells, which is essential for their self-renewal and proliferation. While not a distinct ""subtype"" in the same way as CBCs, it describes a critical functional state of these stem cells. **Most Likely Subtype:** **LGR5+ Crypt Base Columnar (CBC) Stem Cells.** **Step 6. Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis:** The provided marker list, derived from a human large intestine single-cell cluster, is dominated by genes highly characteristic of intestinal stem cells. The top markers, **LGR5** and **ASCL2**, are definitive and well-established regulators of intestinal stem cell identity, self-renewal, and proliferation. LGR5 is the canonical marker for actively cycling crypt base columnar (CBC) stem cells, while ASCL2 is a crucial transcription factor maintaining their stemness, often acting downstream of Wnt signaling. The presence of TDGF1, a co-receptor for Nodal/Activin signaling involved in stem cell maintenance, further supports this annotation. The remaining highly expressed genes are largely pseudogenes or uncharacterized loci, which do not contradict the stem cell identity. Therefore, the cluster most confidently represents **LGR5+ Crypt Base Columnar (CBC) Intestinal Stem Cells**, which are the primary multipotent stem cells responsible for epithelial turnover in the large intestine.

List the Key Functional Markers:** This list is rich in genes associated with neuroendocrine function, hormone synthesis, and secretion. * **GCG (Glucagon):** A key hormone produced by alpha cells in the pancreas and L-cells in the intestine, involved in glucose homeostasis. Its presence strongly suggests an enteroendocrine cell lineage. * **PCSK1 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 1):** An enzyme involved in the proteolytic processing of prohormones and proneuropeptides into their active forms. Essential for the maturation of many peptide hormones, including glucagon, PYY, and insulin. * **UCN3 (Urocortin 3):** A neuropeptide belonging to the corticotropin-releasing hormone family, often expressed in enteroendocrine cells. * **PYY (Peptide YY):** A peptide hormone secreted by L-cells in the gut, involved in appetite regulation and gut motility. * **INSL5 (Insulin-like peptide 5):** A peptide hormone primarily expressed in enteroendocrine L-cells, involved in colon motility and glucose metabolism. * **CHGA (Chromogranin A):** A general marker for neuroendocrine cells, involved in the packaging and storage of peptide hormones and neurotransmitters. * **SCG2 (Secretogranin II), SCGN (Secretagogin), SCG3 (Secretogranin III), SCG5 (Secretogranin V):** These are members of the secretogranin family, often co-expressed with chromogranins in neuroendocrine cells and involved in regulated secretion. * **FEV (FEV transcription factor, ETS family):** A transcription factor crucial for the development and differentiation of enteroendocrine cells, particularly serotonin-producing cells. * **CPLX2 (Complexin 2):** A synaptic protein involved in neurotransmitter release, suggesting a secretory function. * **NKX2-2 (NK2 Homeobox 2):** A transcription factor involved in the development of various neuroendocrine cell types, including pancreatic alpha and beta cells, and intestinal enteroendocrine cells. * **SLC18A1 (Solute Carrier Family 18 Member A1, Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 1 - VMAT1):** Involved in the transport of monoamines (like serotonin) into synaptic vesicles, indicating a capacity for monoamine secretion. * **TPH1 (Tryptophan Hydroxylase 1):** The rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis, strongly indicating serotonin-producing enteroendocrine cells (EC cells). * **INSM1 (Insulinoma-associated protein 1):** A key neuroendocrine transcription factor essential for the differentiation of neuroendocrine cells. * **SNAP25 (Synaptosomal-Associated Protein, 25kDa):** A component of the SNARE complex, essential for vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter/hormone release. * **CHGB (Chromogranin B):** Another general neuroendocrine marker, similar to CHGA. * **SLC32A1 (Solute Carrier Family 32 Member A1, Vesicular GABA Transporter - VGAT):** Involved in the transport of GABA and glycine into synaptic vesicles, suggesting potential for inhibitory neurotransmitter release. * **ABCC8 (ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily C Member 8):** Encodes SUR1, a subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, often found in secretory cells, including pancreatic beta cells and some enteroendocrine cells. * **SCT (Secretin):** A peptide hormone produced by S-cells in the duodenum, involved in regulating gastric acid secretion and pancreatic bicarbonate release. While primarily duodenal, its presence suggests a broader enteroendocrine identity. * **ARX (Aristaless Related Homeobox):** A transcription factor involved in the development of various endocrine cell types, including pancreatic alpha cells and some enteroendocrine cells. * **PRPH (Peripherin):** An intermediate filament protein found in neurons and some neuroendocrine cells. * **INA (Internexin neuronal intermediate filament protein alpha):** Another neuronal intermediate filament protein. * **SLC5A8 (Solute Carrier Family 5 Member 8):** A sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter, its functional role in enteroendocrine cells is less clear but may be related to nutrient sensing or transport. **Step 2. List the Key Cell Type Markers:** Based on the functional markers, the primary cell type indicated is **enteroendocrine cells**. The markers listed above are almost exclusively associated with this lineage. * **GCG, PYY, INSL5, SCT:** Specific peptide hormones produced by different enteroendocrine cell subtypes (L-cells, S-cells, alpha-cells). * **PCSK1, CHGA, CHGB, SCG2, SCGN, SCG3, SCG5, SNAP25, CPLX2:** General neuroendocrine and secretory machinery markers. * **FEV, NKX2-2, INSM1, ARX, RFX6:** Transcription factors critical for enteroendocrine cell development and differentiation. * **TPH1, SLC18A1:** Markers for serotonin synthesis and packaging, indicative of EC cells. **Step 3. Cross-reference Known Databases:** A quick search on scRNA-seq databases (e.g., Human Cell Atlas, PanglaoDB, CellMarker) for ""large intestine enteroendocrine cells"" or ""gut neuroendocrine cells"" consistently shows high expression of genes like *CHGA, CHGB, PCSK1, GCG, PYY, INSL5, TPH1, FEV, INSM1, NKX2-2*. The co-expression of multiple peptide hormones (GCG, PYY, INSL5) along with general neuroendocrine markers and specific transcription factors strongly supports an enteroendocrine identity. The presence of *TPH1* and *SLC18A1* is particularly indicative of serotonin-producing cells. **Step 4. Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type:** The overwhelming evidence points to **Enteroendocrine Cells**. The entire marker list is a textbook representation of the molecular machinery and products of these specialized secretory cells in the gut. **Step 5. Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types:** Given the co-expression of multiple specific hormone genes and transcription factors, this cluster likely represents a mixed population of enteroendocrine cells or a specific subtype with pleiotropic hormone production. 1. **Most Likely: L-cells (Glucagon-like peptide-1/2, Peptide YY, Insulin-like peptide 5 producing cells)** * **Reasoning:** High expression of **GCG, PYY, INSL5** are hallmark markers of L-cells, which are abundant in the large intestine. While GCG is also known for pancreatic alpha cells, its co-expression with PYY and INSL5 in the context of the large intestine strongly points to L-cells, which produce glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1/2) that are structurally related to glucagon and often detected by GCG probes. The presence of general neuroendocrine markers (CHGA, PCSK1, SCG family) and key transcription factors (INSM1, NKX2-2, ARX) further supports this. 2. **Second Most Likely: EC cells (Enterochromaffin cells - Serotonin producing cells)** * **Reasoning:** The presence of **TPH1** (Tryptophan Hydroxylase 1) and **SLC18A1** (VMAT1) are highly specific markers for serotonin synthesis and packaging, which are the defining characteristics of enterochromaffin cells. FEV is also a known transcription factor for EC cell development. It's common for enteroendocrine clusters to contain EC cells, and sometimes L-cells can co-express some EC cell markers or vice-versa, or there might be a continuum. 3. **Third Most Likely: K/L-cell like or other mixed enteroendocrine cell type** * **Reasoning:** The co-expression of GCG, PYY, and INSL5 (L-cell markers) with TPH1 (EC cell marker) suggests either a mixed population within the cluster or a specific enteroendocrine subtype that exhibits characteristics of both. Some studies suggest plasticity or co-expression of markers in certain enteroendocrine cell populations, especially in the context of development or disease. The presence of SCT (Secretin, typically S-cells) further complicates a simple classification, suggesting a broader enteroendocrine identity, possibly representing a progenitor or a less differentiated state, or a rare co-expressing cell. However, given the high expression of L-cell and EC cell markers, these are the dominant features. **Most Likely Subtype:** Based on the prominence and number of specific markers, the cluster is most likely dominated by **L-cells**, with a significant contribution from **EC cells**. The high ranking of GCG, PYY, and INSL5 suggests L-cell characteristics are very strong. **Step 6.

Its presence in the large intestine context strongly points towards enteric nervous system components. * **SOX2 (SRY-Box Transcription Factor 2):** While also a stem cell marker, in the context of neural markers, it can indicate neural progenitor cells or specific neuronal/glial populations. * **FOXD3 (Forkhead Box D3):** Another strong marker for neural crest derivatives, often co-expressed with SOX10 in enteric glia and neurons. * **PTPRZ1 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type Z1):** A known marker for neural stem cells and some glial populations, including oligodendrocytes. * **TUBB2B (Tubulin Beta 2B Class IIb):** A neuronal-specific tubulin isoform. * **NRXN1, NRXN3 (Neurexins):** Presynaptic adhesion molecules, highly characteristic of neurons. * **CDH2 (N-cadherin):** While broadly expressed, its strong presence alongside other neural markers reinforces a neural identity. * **CHL1 (Cell Adhesion Molecule L1 Like):** A neuronal cell adhesion molecule, related to L1CAM. * **GRIK3 (Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor Kainate Type Subunit 3):** A subunit of kainate receptors, which are ionotropic glutamate receptors, indicating neuronal activity. * **ATP1A2 (ATPase Na+/K+ Transporting Subunit Alpha 2):** While present in other excitable cells, its co-expression with other neural markers points to neuronal or glial function. * **KCNMB4 (Potassium Calcium-Activated Channel Subfamily M Beta Member 4):** A regulatory subunit of large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels, found in neurons and other excitable cells. * **TMEM132B (Transmembrane Protein 132B):** Associated with neuronal function and psychiatric disorders. * **GFRA2 (GDNF Family Receptor Alpha 2):** Expressed in various neuronal populations, including enteric neurons. * **CHADL (Chondroadherin Like):** While often associated with cartilage, some studies suggest expression in neural tissues. Its role here is less clear without further context. * **GJC3 (Gap Junction Protein Gamma 3):** A connexin, forming gap junctions. While ubiquitous, specific connexins can be enriched in certain cell types, including glia. * **RHAG (Rh Associated Glycoprotein):** Primarily known for red blood cells, but also found in some neural tissues, though its specificity is low. **Genes with less specific or unclear roles in this context (or potential contaminants/non-coding):** * NKAIN3, CDH19, TSPAN11, MYOT, IGSF11, SLC35F1, AL136298.1, SFRP5, Z97205.2, AL358216.1, MEGF10, SYT10, CADM2, SLITRK2, CRTAC1, ZNF536, CMTM5, LINC01436, TTYH1, WNT6, LPL, CHST9, Z95114.1, FOXD3-AS1, BMS1P10, FAM19A5. Some of these might be expressed at low levels, be non-coding RNAs, or represent less specific markers. CDH19 is an interesting cadherin, but its neural specificity is lower than CDH2. MYOT (Myotilin) is typically associated with muscle, which would be a strong contradiction if this were the primary cell type. Given the overwhelming neural signature, MYOT might represent a minor contaminant or a less understood role in neural cells. --- **Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases** A quick cross-reference of the most prominent markers (PLP1, L1CAM, SOX10, FOXD3, NRXN1, TUBB2B, PTPRZ1) with scRNA-seq databases (e.g., Human Cell Atlas, PanglaoDB, CellMarker, specific enteric nervous system datasets) consistently points towards neural crest-derived cells, specifically neurons and glial cells, particularly Schwann cells or enteric glia. * **PLP1:** A canonical marker for myelinating glia (Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes). * **SOX10 & FOXD3:** Definitive markers for neural crest stem cells and their derivatives, including enteric neurons and glia. * **L1CAM, NRXN1, NRXN3, TUBB2B, GRIK3:** Strongly indicative of neuronal identity and function. * **PTPRZ1:** Found in neural stem cells and some glial populations. The co-expression of these markers, especially the combination of neural crest transcription factors (SOX10, FOXD3) with myelin components (PLP1) and neuronal adhesion/synaptic molecules (L1CAM, NRXN1), is highly characteristic of the enteric nervous system (ENS) within the large intestine. The ENS is often referred to as the ""second brain"" and contains a complex network of neurons and glial cells. --- **Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type** Based on the strong and consistent expression of key markers such as PLP1, L1CAM, SOX10, FOXD3, NRXN1, NRXN3, TUBB2B, PTPRZ1, and GRIK3, the most probable general cell type is **Neural/Glial Cells of the Enteric Nervous System (ENS)**. The presence of both neuronal (NRXN1, NRXN3, TUBB2B, GRIK3, L1CAM) and glial (PLP1, SOX10, FOXD3, PTPRZ1) markers suggests a mixed population or a cell type with characteristics of both, which is common in the ENS where neurons and glia are intimately associated. --- **Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types** Given the general cell type, we need to differentiate between specific neural and glial populations within the ENS. 1. **Enteric Glial Cells (EGCs) / Schwann Cells:** * **Strong supporting markers:** PLP1 (myelin component, highly expressed in Schwann cells), SOX10 (definitive marker for neural crest derivatives including glia), FOXD3 (neural crest, glial progenitor), PTPRZ1 (glial/neural stem cell marker), L1CAM (expressed on some glia). * **Reasoning:** The high expression of PLP1 is a very strong indicator of myelinating cells. In the large intestine, these would primarily be Schwann cells associated with peripheral nerves, or enteric glia which share many characteristics with Schwann cells and can also express myelin-related genes or support neuronal myelination-like functions. SOX10 and FOXD3 are crucial for EGC development and maintenance. 2. **Enteric Neurons:** * **Strong supporting markers:** NRXN1, NRXN3 (presynaptic adhesion molecules, highly specific to neurons), TUBB2B (neuronal tubulin), GRIK3 (ionotropic glutamate receptor, neuronal), L1CAM (neuronal adhesion), SYT10 (Synaptotagmin 10, involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis). * **Reasoning:** The presence of multiple synaptic and neuronal structural genes strongly points to a neuronal component. Enteric neurons are diverse, controlling gut motility, secretion, and blood flow. The co-expression with glial markers suggests either a mixed cluster or a close interaction. 3. **Neural Progenitor Cells (within ENS):** * **Strong supporting markers:** SOX2 (stem/progenitor marker, also in neural progenitors), SOX10, FOXD3 (neural crest progenitor markers), PTPRZ1 (neural stem cell marker). * **Reasoning:** While mature neurons and glia are present, the co-expression of SOX2, SOX10, and FOXD3, which are critical for neural crest development and maintenance of progenitor states, suggests that a subset of these cells might retain progenitor characteristics or represent a developmental stage within the ENS. These cells could differentiate into both neurons and glia. **Most Likely Subtype:** Considering the very high expression of **PLP1** (a major myelin component) and the definitive neural crest markers **SOX10** and **FOXD3**, alongside other glial-associated markers like PTPRZ1, the most likely primary subtype, or at least a very significant component of this cluster, is **Enteric Glial Cells (EGCs) / Schwann Cells**. While there are clear neuronal markers, the prominence of PLP1 pushes the balance towards a strong glial presence, potentially including myelinating Schwann cells or enteric glia with myelin-like functions. It's highly probable this cluster represents a population enriched for enteric glia, possibly with some co-clustered neurons due to their intimate association in the ENS. --- **Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis** This cell cluster from the human large intestine exhibits a strong and consistent expression profile indicative of the **Enteric Nervous System (ENS)**. Key markers such as **PLP1, SOX10, FOXD3, L1CAM, NRXN1, NRXN3, TUBB2B, and PTPRZ1** collectively point towards a population composed of neural crest-derived cells. The presence of **PLP1**, a canonical myelin component, alongside the definitive neural crest transcription factors **SOX10** and **FOXD3**, strongly suggests a significant **glial component**. Concurrently, markers like **NRXN1, NRXN3, TUBB2B, and GRIK3** indicate the presence of **neurons**. Therefore, the most probable general cell type is **Neural/Glial Cells of the Enteric Nervous System**. The top three most probable sub cell types are: 1. **Enteric Glial Cells (EGCs) / Schwann Cells:** Strongly supported by PLP1, SOX10, FOXD3, PTPRZ1. 2. **Enteric Neurons:** Supported by NRXN1, NRXN3, TUBB2B, GRIK3, L1CAM. 3. **Neural Progenitor Cells (within ENS):** Supported by SOX2, SOX10, FOXD3, PTPRZ1. Based on the high ranking of **PLP1** and the robust co-expression of **SOX10** and **FOXD3**, the most likely specific subtype is **Enteric Glial Cells (EGCs) / Schwann Cells**, potentially representing a mixed cluster with closely associated enteric neurons.

These genes are directly involved in antibody production and function. * **Immunoglobulin Light Chain Genes:** * **IGLL5 (Immunoglobulin Lambda-Like Polypeptide 5):** A pseudo-light chain gene, often expressed in pre-B cells and plasma cells, involved in B cell development and antibody secretion. Its high expression suggests a mature B cell lineage, particularly plasma cells. * **IGLV6-57, IGLC3, IGLC2, IGLV3-1, IGLV2-11:** These are various immunoglobulin lambda light chain variable and constant region genes. Their presence indicates active production of lambda light chains, a component of antibodies. * **IGKC, IGKV4-1, IGKV1-5, IGKV3-20:** These are various immunoglobulin kappa light chain constant and variable region genes.

Its high expression is a hallmark of plasma cells actively secreting polymeric antibodies, especially IgA and IgM. * **IGHV3-7, IGHG1, IGHV3-23, IGHG3, IGHM, IGHV3-74, IGHA1, IGHA2:** These are various immunoglobulin heavy chain variable and constant region genes. * **IGHG1, IGHG3:** Indicate production of IgG antibodies. * **IGHM:** Indicates production of IgM antibodies. * **IGHA1, IGHA2:** Indicate production of IgA antibodies. * **IGHV3-7, IGHV3-23, IGHV3-74:** Variable regions contributing to antibody diversity. * **Other Immune-Related Markers:** * **TNFRSF17 (B Cell Maturation Antigen - BCMA):** A receptor for BAFF and APRIL, crucial for plasma cell survival and differentiation. Its high expression is a strong indicator of plasma cells. * **MZB1 (Marginal Zone B and B1 Cell Specific Protein 1):** A chaperone protein involved in immunoglobulin assembly and secretion, highly expressed in plasma cells. * **CCL3 (Chemokine (C-C motif) Ligand 3):** A chemokine involved in immune cell recruitment. While not exclusive to plasma cells, its presence in an immune context is relevant. * **LILRB4 (Leukocyte Immunoglobulin Like Receptor B4):** An inhibitory receptor expressed on myeloid cells, but also reported on some B cell subsets and plasma cells, though less specific than the immunoglobulin genes. * **FCRL5 (Fc Receptor Like 5):** An inhibitory receptor expressed on a subset of B cells and plasma cells, particularly those involved in chronic immune responses. * **CCR10 (C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 10):** A chemokine receptor involved in homing to mucosal tissues, including the gut, and can be expressed by plasma cells. * **APOBEC3A (Apolipoprotein B mRNA Editing Enzyme Catalytic Subunit 3A):** An enzyme involved in innate immunity and retroviral restriction, also implicated in B cell somatic hypermutation. ## Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers Based on the functional markers, the key cell type markers are predominantly related to the B cell lineage, specifically mature B cells and plasma cells. * **Plasma Cell Specific Markers:** * **IGLL5, JCHAIN, TNFRSF17 (BCMA), MZB1:** These are highly specific and strong indicators of plasma cells. Their co-expression at high levels is almost pathognomonic for this cell type. * **IGHG1, IGHG3, IGHM, IGHA1, IGHA2:** The presence of multiple immunoglobulin heavy chain constant regions (IgG, IgM, IgA) indicates class-switched and unswitched antibody production, characteristic of plasma cells. * **B Cell Lineage Markers (more general, but support plasma cell identity in this context):** * All the various **IGLV, IGLC, IGKV, IGKC, IGHV** genes indicate cells actively producing immunoglobulins, placing them firmly within the B cell lineage. * **Other Markers (less specific but potentially supportive):** * **FAM92B, AC026369.3, AC104699.1, LINC02362, AL391056.1, UBE2QL1, LINC00309, AL133467.1, GPRC5D, DNAAF1, AP002852.1, AC007569.1, CXorf21, RNU1-85P, U62317.4, TXNDC5, LINC02384, BFSP2, AC106897.1:** Many of these are uncharacterized LINC RNAs, pseudogenes, or genes with less clear roles in immune cell identity. Their high expression might reflect specific metabolic states or cellular processes within this highly active cell type, or simply be highly expressed but not cell-type specific. * **MYL2 (Myosin Light Chain 2):** Primarily associated with muscle contraction. Its presence here is unusual for an immune cell and might indicate contamination, or a very specific, less common function in this cell type, or perhaps a non-coding RNA that shares a similar name. Given the overwhelming immunoglobulin signature, it's likely an outlier or a non-specific transcript. * **AMPD1 (Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase 1):** Involved in purine metabolism. Not a specific immune cell marker. * **ANKRD36BP2 (Ankyrin Repeat Domain 36B Pseudogene 2):** A pseudogene, unlikely to be a specific marker. * **DERL3 (Derlin 3):** Involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Plasma cells have a highly developed ER for antibody synthesis and secretion, so high DERL3 could reflect this high protein synthesis activity. * **BMP6 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6):** Involved in bone and cartilage development, but also has roles in immune regulation and inflammation. Its expression in plasma cells is not a primary defining feature but could be context-dependent. ## Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases Cross-referencing these markers with scRNA-seq databases (e.g., Human Cell Atlas, ImmGen, PanglaoDB, CellMarker) and literature strongly supports the identification of plasma cells. * **IGLL5, JCHAIN, TNFRSF17 (BCMA), MZB1, IGHG1, IGHG3, IGHM, IGHA1, IGHA2, IGKC, IGLC2/3:** These genes are consistently reported as highly specific and enriched markers for plasma cells across various tissues, including the large intestine (gut-associated lymphoid tissue). * The co-expression of multiple heavy and light chain constant regions, along with JCHAIN, is a definitive signature of antibody-secreting cells. * The presence of both IgA and IgG constant regions is common for plasma cells in mucosal tissues like the large intestine, which are critical sites for IgA production. ## Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type Based on the overwhelming and highly specific expression of immunoglobulin genes (heavy and light chains, variable and constant regions), JCHAIN, TNFRSF17 (BCMA), and MZB1, the most probable general cell type is **Plasma Cell**. These cells are terminally differentiated B lymphocytes specialized in producing and secreting large quantities of antibodies. The presence of JCHAIN further indicates the secretion of polymeric antibodies (IgA, IgM), which is particularly relevant in mucosal tissues like the large intestine. ## Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types Given the strong plasma cell signature, the sub-types would primarily relate to plasma cell differentiation or location. 1. **Most Likely: IgA-secreting Plasma Cells (or Mucosal Plasma Cells):** * **Reasoning:** The high expression of **JCHAIN** (essential for polymeric IgA and IgM) combined with **IGHA1** and **IGHA2** (IgA heavy chain constant regions) strongly points towards IgA-secreting plasma cells. The large intestine is a primary site for IgA production, which plays a crucial role in mucosal immunity. The presence of **CCR10**, a chemokine receptor involved in homing to mucosal tissues, further supports this. 2. **Second Most Likely: IgG-secreting Plasma Cells:** * **Reasoning:** The significant expression of **IGHG1** and **IGHG3** (IgG heavy chain constant regions) indicates that a substantial proportion of these plasma cells are also producing IgG antibodies. While IgA is dominant in mucosal sites, IgG-secreting plasma cells are also present and contribute to systemic and local immunity. 3. **Third Most Likely: IgM-secreting Plasma Cells:** * **Reasoning:** The presence of **IGHM** (IgM heavy chain constant region) indicates that some cells are producing IgM. IgM is typically the first antibody produced in a primary immune response and can also be found in mucosal tissues, often in polymeric form (facilitated by JCHAIN). **Most Likely Subtype:** Based on the strong presence of **JCHAIN** and **IGHA1/IGHA2** in a large intestine context, the most likely specific subtype is **IgA-secreting Plasma Cells (Mucosal Plasma Cells)**. The co-expression of IgG and IgM indicates a diverse antibody response, but IgA is particularly characteristic of the gut. ## Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis The cell cluster exhibits a highly characteristic gene expression profile dominated by immunoglobulin genes. Key markers include **IGLL5, JCHAIN, TNFRSF17 (BCMA), MZB1**, and numerous immunoglobulin heavy (e.g., **IGHG1, IGHG3, IGHM, IGHA1, IGHA2**) and light chain (e.g., **IGKC, IGLC3**) genes. This signature is unequivocally indicative of **Plasma Cells**, which are terminally differentiated B lymphocytes specialized in antibody secretion. The high expression of **JCHAIN** and **IGHA1/IGHA2**, coupled with the tissue origin (large intestine), strongly suggests a primary role in mucosal immunity. Therefore, the most probable general cell type is **Plasma Cell**. The top three most probable sub-cell types are **IgA-secreting Plasma Cells** (most likely, given JCHAIN and IgA heavy chains in the gut), followed by **IgG-secreting Plasma Cells**, and then **IgM-secreting Plasma Cells**, reflecting the diverse antibody classes produced. The most likely specific subtype is **IgA-secreting Plasma Cells (Mucosal Plasma Cells)**.

List the Key Cell Type Markers:** Based on the provided list, there are no specific markers for differentiated large intestine cell types (e.g., enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, enteroendocrine cells, immune cells, stromal cells). The entire list is dominated by proliferation-associated genes. **3. Cross-reference Known Databases:** A quick search of these genes (e.g., MKI67, AURKB, TOP2A, CDK1, PLK1, CCNB2, UBE2C, BIRC5) in scRNA-seq databases or gene expression atlases consistently identifies them as markers of proliferating cells across various tissues. In the context of the large intestine, this strongly points to actively dividing cells within the crypts. **4. Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type:** Given the overwhelming expression of genes involved in DNA replication, cell cycle progression, and mitosis, the most probable general cell type is **Proliferating Cells**. **5. Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types:** Within the large intestine, proliferating cells are primarily found in the crypts of Lieberkühn, where they continuously replenish the epithelial lining. 1. **Most Likely: Intestinal Stem Cells (ISCs) and/or Transit-Amplifying (TA) Cells:** * **Reasoning:** ISCs are the primary source of all epithelial cells in the intestine and are highly proliferative. They divide to self-renew and to produce TA cells. TA cells are also highly proliferative and undergo several rounds of division as they migrate up the crypt before differentiating. The markers provided are characteristic of both ISCs and TA cells in their active cell cycle phases. The high expression of core cell cycle machinery (CDK1, Cyclins, PLK1, AURKB, MKI67, TOP2A, etc.) is exactly what would be expected from these rapidly dividing populations. * **Distinction:** While some markers might lean slightly more towards one or the other (e.g., Lgr5 is a classic ISC marker, but it's not on this list), the general proliferative signature is shared. Without specific ISC-defining markers (like *LGR5*, *OLFM4*, *ASCL2*) or TA-specific markers (which are often defined by their proliferative state and lack of full differentiation markers), it's difficult to definitively separate them solely based on this list. However, they represent the bulk of the proliferating epithelial population. 2. **Second Most Likely: Activated Immune Cells (e.g., T cells, B cells) undergoing clonal expansion:** * **Reasoning:** While less common as a dominant cluster in epithelial-focused scRNA-seq unless specifically enriched, immune cells, particularly T and B lymphocytes, can undergo rapid clonal expansion in response to infection or inflammation. During this process, they would express many of the same proliferation markers (MKI67, cell cycle genes). * **Why less likely than ISCs/TA cells:** The large intestine epithelium is characterized by constant turnover driven by ISCs and TA cells, making them the most abundant proliferating population in a typical healthy tissue sample. If this were an immune cell cluster, one might expect to see some immune-specific markers (e.g., CD3, CD8, CD4, CD19, specific cytokine receptors) alongside the proliferation markers, which are absent here. The sheer number and variety of cell cycle genes strongly point to a fundamental proliferative program rather than a transient immune response. 3. **Third Most Likely: Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) or Fibroblasts undergoing proliferation (e.g., during wound healing or in culture):** * **Reasoning:** Mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts and MSCs, can proliferate, especially in response to injury or in culture. They would also express cell cycle genes. * **Why less likely:** Similar to immune cells, if this were a mesenchymal population, one would typically expect to see some mesenchymal-specific markers (e.g., COL1A1, ACTA2, PDGFRA, CD90, CD73) in addition to the proliferation markers. Their proliferative rate in healthy tissue is generally lower than that of epithelial crypt cells. **Most Likely Subtype based on markers:** Intestinal Stem Cells (ISCs) and/or Transit-Amplifying (TA) Cells. The high expression of a broad spectrum of cell cycle and mitotic genes is highly characteristic of these rapidly dividing epithelial populations responsible for intestinal homeostasis. **6. Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis:** The single-cell cluster from human large intestine tissue exhibits a robust and comprehensive expression profile of genes critically involved in cell cycle progression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and mitosis. Key markers include classical proliferation indicators such as MKI67, along with numerous cyclins (CCNB2, CCNA2), cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK1), mitotic kinases (AURKB, PLK1, TTK, PBK), DNA replication factors (CDC45, RRM2, CDT1, GINS2), and structural components of the mitotic apparatus (CENPA, BIRC5, KIF family members, NDC80 complex components like NUF2, SKA3, SPC24, SPC25). The absence of any specific differentiation markers for mature intestinal epithelial cells, immune cells, or stromal cells, coupled with the overwhelming presence of proliferation-associated genes, strongly indicates a highly proliferative cell population. Based on this evidence, the most probable general cell type is **Proliferating Cells**. Within the large intestine, the most likely specific subtypes are **Intestinal Stem Cells (ISCs) and/or Transit-Amplifying (TA) Cells**, which are responsible for the continuous renewal of the intestinal epithelium within the crypts of Lieberkühn. Other possibilities, such as activated immune cells or proliferating mesenchymal cells, are less likely given the lack of specific lineage markers for those cell types and the dominant role of epithelial proliferation in intestinal homeostasis.
