They are crucial for inducing apoptosis in target cells. The presence of multiple granzymes (A, B, H, K, M) strongly suggests cytotoxic function. * **PRF1 (Perforin 1):** Perforin is a pore-forming protein released by cytotoxic lymphocytes. It creates pores in the target cell membrane, allowing granzymes to enter and initiate apoptosis. This is a definitive marker of cytotoxic activity. * **NKG7 (Natural Killer Cell Granule Protein 7):** A transmembrane protein found in the granules of NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, involved in granule exocytosis and cytotoxic function. * **CTSW (Cathepsin W):** A cysteine protease expressed in NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, potentially involved in granule maturation or target cell killing. * **Chemokines/Cytokines:** * **XCL2, XCL1 (X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 and 1):** These are lymphotactin chemokines, primarily produced by NK cells and CD8+ T cells, involved in attracting immune cells. * **CCL4, CCL4L2, CCL5 (Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4, 4-like 2, 5):** These are inflammatory chemokines produced by various immune cells, including NK cells and T cells, to recruit other immune cells to sites of inflammation or infection. * **IFNG (Interferon Gamma):** A potent pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by NK cells and T cells, critical for antiviral and anti-tumor immunity, and macrophage activation. * **Immune Checkpoints/Regulatory Molecules:** * **TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains):** An inhibitory receptor expressed on NK cells and T cells, involved in immune suppression. * **LAG3 (Lymphocyte-activation gene 3):** An inhibitory receptor expressed on activated T cells and NK cells, contributing to immune exhaustion. * **PTPN22 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non-Receptor Type 22):** A phosphatase involved in regulating T cell activation and signaling. * **TMIGD2 (Transmembrane and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 2):** Also known as CD28H, a co-stimulatory molecule expressed on T cells. * **Other Immune-related:** * **CD7:** A transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on T cells, NK cells, and some myeloid cells, involved in T cell activation and adhesion. * **IL21R (Interleukin 21 Receptor):** Receptor for IL-21, a cytokine important for the differentiation and function of T cells, B cells, and NK cells. * **GPR18 (G Protein-Coupled Receptor 18):** A receptor for endocannabinoids, expressed on various immune cells, with potential roles in immune modulation. * **SH2D1A (SH2 Domain Containing 1A):** Involved in NK cell and T cell signaling, mutations are associated with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome. * **IKZF2 (IKAROS Family Zinc Finger 2):** Also known as HELIOS, a transcription factor expressed in regulatory T cells and activated T cells, involved in T cell development and function. ## Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers These markers are highly specific to particular immune cell lineages. * **Natural Killer (NK) Cell Markers:** * **KLRC2 (NKG2C), KLRK1 (NKG2D), KLRC4 (NKG2F), KLRD1 (CD94):** These are members of the C-type lectin-like receptor family, characteristic of NK cells. NKG2C and NKG2D are activating receptors, while CD94 forms a heterodimer with NKG2A (inhibitory) or NKG2C (activating). Their strong presence is a hallmark of NK cells. * **CRTAM (Cytotoxic and Regulatory T cell Molecule):** Expressed on NK cells and activated CD8+ T cells, involved in cell-cell adhesion and cytokine production. * **CD160:** A receptor expressed on NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, involved in inhibitory or co-stimulatory signaling. * **T Cell Markers (specifically Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte - CTL):** * **CD8B, CD8A:** Components of the CD8 co-receptor, which is characteristic of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Their presence, especially alongside granzymes and perforin, points strongly to CTLs. * **TRGC2, TRGC1 (T Cell Receptor Gamma Constant 2 and 1):** These are components of the gamma-delta T cell receptor. The presence of these markers indicates a gamma-delta T cell lineage. Gamma-delta T cells are a distinct T cell subset with innate-like functions, often found in mucosal tissues like the intestine, and can exhibit cytotoxic activity. * **General Lymphocyte Markers:** * **CD7:** As mentioned above, expressed on T cells, NK cells, and some myeloid cells. ## Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases and Literature * **NK Cell Specificity:** The overwhelming presence of **KLRC2, KLRK1, KLRC4, KLRD1, NKG7, XCL1, XCL2, CRTAM, CD160** points very strongly towards an NK cell or NK-like cell population. These are canonical NK cell activating and inhibitory receptors and granule proteins. * **Cytotoxic Function:** The high expression of **GZMH, GZMA, GZMB, GZMK, GZMM, PRF1, CTSW** unequivocally indicates a cytotoxic cell type. Both NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) exhibit this machinery. * **T Cell Specificity:** The presence of **CD8A, CD8B** points to CD8+ T cells. The presence of **TRGC1, TRGC2** specifically points to gamma-delta T cells. * **Intestinal Context:** In the large intestine, both conventional NK cells, tissue-resident NK cells, and various T cell subsets (including CD8+ T cells and gamma-delta T cells) are present and play crucial roles in immune surveillance and host defense. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the gut often include CD8+ T cells and gamma-delta T cells with cytotoxic capabilities. **Initial Synthesis:** We have a strong signal for both NK cell markers and cytotoxic T cell markers (specifically CD8+ and gamma-delta T cell markers), all within a cytotoxic functional context. This suggests a cell type that shares characteristics of both, or a mixed population, or a specific subset of T cells that acquire NK-like features, or vice-versa. The high ranking of NK-specific markers (KLRC2, KLRK1, KLRC4, KLRD1) is particularly striking. ## Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type Based on the combined evidence, the most probable general cell type is a **Cytotoxic Lymphocyte**. This umbrella term encompasses both Natural Killer (NK) cells and Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs), as the marker list contains strong indicators for both. The high expression of granzymes, perforin, and NKG7 are definitive for cytotoxic function, while the specific receptor profiles differentiate between NK and T cell lineages. ## Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types Given the strong and somewhat overlapping marker expression, we need to carefully weigh the evidence for specific subsets. 1. **Most Likely: Activated/Effector Natural Killer (NK) Cells or NK-like T cells (e.g., NKT-like cells, or highly cytotoxic CD8+ T cells with NK features).** * **Reasoning:** The top-ranked markers include a significant number of canonical NK cell receptors (KLRC2, KLRK1, KLRC4, KLRD1, CRTAM, CD160). These are highly specific to NK cells. The presence of XCL1/XCL2 and NKG7 further supports this. The robust expression of multiple granzymes (GZMH, GZMA, GZMB, GZMK, GZMM) and PRF1 confirms their cytotoxic effector function. While CD8A/B are present, their ranking is lower than many NK-specific markers. Some NK cells can express low levels of CD8. Alternatively, highly activated CD8+ T cells can upregulate some NK-associated genes, or this could represent a population of NKT-like cells or innate-like T cells. However, the sheer number and high ranking of *bona fide* NK receptors make NK cells a very strong candidate. 2. **Second Most Likely: Cytotoxic Gamma-Delta (γδ) T Cells.** * **Reasoning:** The presence of **TRGC2** and **TRGC1** is a definitive marker for gamma-delta T cells. These cells are abundant in mucosal tissues like the large intestine (often as IELs) and are well-known for their innate-like cytotoxic capabilities, expressing granzymes, perforin, and often NK receptors (like NKG2D/KLRK1, CD160, CRTAM). They also often express CD8 (either alpha-alpha homodimer or alpha-beta heterodimer). This cell type perfectly fits the cytotoxic profile and the presence of both T cell (TRGC, CD8) and NK-like (KLRK1, CD160, CRTAM) markers. The ranking of TRGC2 and TRGC1 is lower than the top NK markers, but still significant. 3. **Third Most Likely: Activated/Effector CD8+ Alpha-Beta (αβ) T Cells.** * **Reasoning:** The presence of **CD8A** and **CD8B** (components of the conventional CD8 co-receptor) strongly indicates a CD8+ T cell lineage. These cells are the primary cytotoxic T lymphocytes in adaptive immunity and express high levels of granzymes (GZMA, GZMB, GZMH, GZMK, GZMM) and perforin (PRF1). They also produce IFNG and chemokines like CCL4/CCL5. Activated CD8+ T cells can also express some NK-associated receptors like KLRK1 (NKG2D), CRTAM, and CD160, and immune checkpoints like TIGIT and LAG3. However, the prominent and highly ranked expression of *multiple* classical NK receptors (KLRC2, KLRC4, KLRD1) in addition to KLRK1 is less typical for a standard activated CD8+ alpha-beta T cell, making it slightly less likely than a gamma-delta T cell or a more NK-like cell. **Most Likely Subtype:** Given the very high ranking of multiple canonical NK cell receptors (KLRC2, KLRK1, KLRC4, KLRD1) alongside the cytotoxic machinery, the most likely specific subtype is **Activated/Effector Natural Killer (NK) Cells**, potentially with some overlapping features or a continuum with innate-like T cells. The presence of TRGC1/2 and CD8A/B suggests that if not pure NK cells, it's a population with strong innate-like cytotoxic T cell characteristics, such as gamma-delta T cells or NKT-like cells, which often blur the lines with NK cells in terms of effector function and receptor expression. However, the sheer number and high expression of *NK-specific* C-type lectin receptors push the annotation towards NK cells as the primary identity. ## Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis The cell cluster exhibits a highly cytotoxic phenotype, characterized by the abundant expression of granzymes (GZMH, GZMA, GZMB, GZMK, GZMM) and perforin (PRF1), along with NKG7, CTSW, and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (IFNG, XCL1, XCL2, CCL4, CCL5). Critically, the marker list is dominated by canonical Natural Killer (NK) cell receptors, including KLRC2 (NKG2C), KLRK1 (NKG2D), KLRC4 (NKG2F), KLRD1 (CD94), CRTAM, and CD160, which are highly ranked. While CD8A/B and TRGC1/TRGC2 (gamma-delta T cell receptor components) are also present, their ranking is generally lower than the core NK receptor set. This suggests a primary identity as **Activated/Effector Natural Killer (NK) Cells**. The co-expression of CD8 and gamma-delta TCR components, along with NK receptors, could indicate a population of innate-like cytotoxic T cells (e.g., gamma-delta T cells or NKT-like cells) that share many features with NK cells, especially in mucosal tissues like the large intestine. However, the overwhelming and high-ranking presence of multiple NK-specific C-type lectin receptors points most strongly to an NK cell lineage. **FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED** | Coupling Validator: Validation result: VALIDATION PASSED | Formatting Agent: ```json { ""main_cell_type"": ""Cytotoxic Lymphocyte"", ""sub_cell_types"": [ ""Activated/Effector Natural Killer (NK) Cells"", ""Cytotoxic Gamma-Delta (γδ) T Cells"", ""Activated/Effector CD8+ Alpha-Beta (αβ) T Cells"" ], ""possible_mixed_cell_types"": [ ""NK-like T cells (e.g., NKT-like cells, or highly cytotoxic CD8+ T cells with NK features)"", ""innate-like T cells"" ] } ```"

List the Key Functional Markers:** Upon reviewing the provided gene list, several genes stand out as having known functional roles relevant to cell identity, particularly in the context of the intestine. * **LGR5 (Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5):** This is a canonical and highly specific marker for actively cycling intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in various tissues, including the large intestine. LGR5+ cells are multipotent and responsible for maintaining the intestinal epithelium. Its high expression here is a very strong indicator. * **ASCL2 (Achaete-scute homolog 2):** A basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, ASCL2 is a critical downstream effector of Wnt signaling and is essential for maintaining LGR5+ intestinal stem cells. It promotes stem cell self-renewal and inhibits differentiation. Its co-expression with LGR5 further strengthens the stem cell hypothesis. * **SLC39A2 (Solute Carrier Family 39 Member 2, also known as ZIP2):** This gene encodes a zinc transporter. While not a definitive cell type marker on its own, zinc homeostasis is crucial for cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune function in the gut. Its presence might indicate active metabolic processes or specific nutrient handling within the cell population. In the context of stem cells, active metabolism is expected. **Step 2. List the Key Cell Type Markers:** Based on the functional markers identified, the primary cell type markers point strongly towards intestinal stem cells. * **LGR5:** As mentioned above, this is the most prominent and specific marker for intestinal stem cells. Its presence at a high rank is highly significant. * **ASCL2:** Reinforces the identification of LGR5+ stem cells. Many of the other genes in the list are pseudogenes (e.g., HMGN2P6, PPIAP40, RPL7P54, EIF5AP4, NPM1P6, PPIAP11, RPL41P1, CYCSP55, HMGN2P4, TPI1P1, RPL41P5, PPIAP29, HNRNPA1P4, RPL9P21, PPIAP31, HMGN1P36, HMGN2P41, RPS26P39, FABP5P7, SDHDP6, ATP5PFP1, EEF1A1P5, RPSAP8, HMGN2P3, KRT8P13, RPL21P16, RPSAP15, HMGN1P38, RPL7P6) or uncharacterized loci (e.g., AL031284.1, AC012085.1, AC010132.3, AC008694.2, AC092670.1, AC090498.1, AL162151.2, AC016596.2, AL603825.1, AC005884.2, AL035411.1, AF279873.1, AC112491.1, AC022968.1). While pseudogenes can sometimes be expressed and even have regulatory roles, their high prevalence in this list, especially at the top, might suggest a technical artifact (e.g., mapping issues, high background expression in highly proliferative cells) or a specific biological context where their expression is genuinely elevated. However, for definitive cell type identification, we prioritize well-established protein-coding genes with known functions. **Step 3. Cross-reference Known Databases:** * **LGR5:** Widely recognized in scRNA-seq databases (e.g., Human Cell Atlas, GEO, ArrayExpress) and literature as the primary marker for intestinal stem cells in both small and large intestine. Its expression defines the crypt base columnar (CBC) cells. * **ASCL2:** Consistently found to be co-expressed with LGR5 in intestinal stem cells and is a key regulator of their identity and function. * **TDGF1 (Teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor 1, also known as Cripto):** While not as specific as LGR5, TDGF1 is a co-receptor for TGF-beta and Nodal signaling pathways and is involved in embryonic development and stem cell maintenance. It has been reported to be expressed in intestinal stem cells and progenitor cells, contributing to their self-renewal and differentiation potential. Its presence further supports a stem/progenitor cell identity. * **IGFBPL1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein Like 1):** While not a canonical stem cell marker, IGFBPL1 has been implicated in cell growth and proliferation. Its expression in highly proliferative cells like stem cells is plausible. **Step 4. Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type:** Based on the strong and specific expression of **LGR5** and **ASCL2**, the most probable general cell type is **Intestinal Stem Cells**. The presence of TDGF1 and IGFBPL1 further supports a highly proliferative and self-renewing cell population. **Step 5. Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types:** Given the context of ""intestinal stem cells"" as the general type, the sub-types would typically refer to different states or specific populations within the stem cell compartment. 1. **LGR5+ Crypt Base Columnar (CBC) Stem Cells:** This is the most likely and direct interpretation. LGR5 is the defining marker for these actively cycling, multipotent stem cells located at the crypt base, responsible for continuous epithelial renewal. The high expression of ASCL2 further confirms this identity, as ASCL2 is crucial for maintaining the LGR5+ state. 2. **Early Intestinal Progenitor Cells (Transit-Amplifying Cells):** While LGR5 is highest in true stem cells, some early progenitor cells that are still highly proliferative and retain some stem-like features might express LGR5 at lower levels or express other markers associated with rapid division. However, the high ranking of LGR5 here points more strongly to the definitive stem cell population. The presence of genes like IGFBPL1 and SLC39A2, which are involved in growth and metabolism, could also be consistent with highly proliferative progenitor cells. 3. **Secretory Progenitor Cells (e.g., early Goblet or Enteroendocrine progenitors):** While LGR5+ cells are multipotent and can give rise to all lineages, specific markers for secretory lineages (e.g., MUC2 for Goblet, CHGA for enteroendocrine) are not highly ranked here. However, some early committed progenitors might still retain some stem cell markers or express genes involved in general cell growth. This is less likely than CBC stem cells given the strong LGR5/ASCL2 signal. **Most Likely Subtype:** The most likely subtype is **LGR5+ Crypt Base Columnar (CBC) Stem Cells**. The high ranking of LGR5, a definitive marker for these cells, along with ASCL2, a key regulator of their identity, provides compelling evidence. **Step 6. Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis:** The single-cell cluster from the large intestine tissue is confidently identified as **LGR5+ Crypt Base Columnar (CBC) Intestinal Stem Cells**. This annotation is primarily driven by the high expression of **LGR5**, the canonical marker for actively cycling, multipotent intestinal stem cells, and **ASCL2**, a critical transcription factor essential for maintaining the LGR5+ stem cell state. The presence of TDGF1, involved in stem cell maintenance, further supports this identification. While many pseudogenes are present in the list, their functional relevance for cell type annotation is limited compared to the highly specific protein-coding markers. The overall gene expression profile strongly indicates a population of highly proliferative and self-renewing cells responsible for intestinal epithelial homeostasis.

List the Key Functional Markers:** This list is rich with genes involved in hormone production, neuroendocrine signaling, and secretory processes. * **GCG (Glucagon):** A well-known peptide hormone, primarily associated with glucose regulation, but also found in enteroendocrine cells of the gut. * **PCSK1 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 1):** An enzyme crucial for the proteolytic processing of prohormones and proneuropeptides into their active forms.

While primarily duodenal, its presence suggests a broader enteroendocrine identity. * **ARX (Aristaless Related Homeobox):** A transcription factor involved in the development of various endocrine cell types, including pancreatic alpha cells and enteroendocrine cells. * **PRPH (Peripherin):** An intermediate filament protein found in neurons and some neuroendocrine cells. * **INA (Internexin Alpha):** Another intermediate filament protein found in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. * **SLC5A8 (Solute Carrier Family 5 Member 8):** A sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter, its role in enteroendocrine cells is less directly linked to hormone production but could be involved in nutrient sensing or transport. **Step 2. List the Key Cell Type Markers:** The overwhelming majority of the functional markers listed above are highly specific to **enteroendocrine cells (EECs)**. There are no clear markers for other major large intestine cell types (e.g., enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, immune cells, stromal cells). * **GCG, PYY, INSL5, UCN3, SCT:** These are specific peptide hormones produced by different subtypes of enteroendocrine cells. * **PCSK1, CHGA, CHGB, SCG2, SCGN, SCG3, SCG5:** General markers for neuroendocrine/enteroendocrine cells, indicating their secretory nature. * **FEV, NKX2-2, INSM1, ARX, RFX6:** Transcription factors critical for the development and differentiation of enteroendocrine cells. * **TPH1, SLC18A1:** Markers for serotonin-producing enteroendocrine cells (EC cells). * **SNAP25, CPLX2:** Components of the secretory machinery, characteristic of neuroendocrine cells. **Step 3. Cross-reference Known Databases:** A quick search in scRNA-seq databases (e.g., Human Cell Atlas, PanglaoDB, CellMarker) for ""large intestine"" and ""enteroendocrine cells"" consistently shows high expression of genes like *CHGA, CHGB, PCSK1, FEV, INSM1, PYY, GCG, UCN3, INSL5, TPH1, SCT* in these cell populations. The co-expression of multiple peptide hormones (GCG, PYY, INSL5, UCN3, SCT) along with general neuroendocrine markers and key transcription factors strongly points towards an enteroendocrine identity. The presence of *TPH1* and *SLC18A1* further refines this, indicating a subset capable of serotonin synthesis. **Step 4. Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type:** Based on the extensive list of highly expressed markers, the most probable general cell type is **Enteroendocrine Cells (EECs)**. These cells are specialized chemosensory cells scattered throughout the gastrointestinal epithelium, responsible for producing and secreting a wide array of hormones and neuropeptides that regulate digestion, metabolism, and gut motility. The presence of multiple peptide hormones, processing enzymes, secretory granule components, and specific transcription factors leaves little doubt about this general classification. **Step 5. Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types:** Enteroendocrine cells are highly heterogeneous, with different subtypes producing distinct sets of hormones. 1. **Most Likely: L-cells (PYY/GCG/INSL5/UCN3 producing)** * **Reasoning:** The strong co-expression of **PYY, GCG, INSL5, and UCN3** is highly characteristic of L-cells, particularly those found in the distal gut (large intestine). L-cells are known for producing multiple hormones, including PYY, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1, encoded by GCG), and INSL5. UCN3 is also a known product of L-cells. The presence of *PCSK1* is essential for processing the pro-glucagon peptide into GLP-1 and other active forms. * **Supporting markers:** *CHGA, CHGB, PCSK1, FEV, INSM1, NKX2-2* are all consistent with L-cell identity. 2. **Second Most Likely: EC cells (Enterochromaffin cells - Serotonin producing)** * **Reasoning:** The presence of **TPH1** (Tryptophan Hydroxylase 1) and **SLC18A1** (VMAT1) are strong indicators of serotonin-producing enterochromaffin (EC) cells. TPH1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis, and VMAT1 packages serotonin into vesicles for release. EC cells are the most abundant EEC subtype in the gut. * **Supporting markers:** General neuroendocrine markers like *CHGA, CHGB, PCSK1, SNAP25* are also expressed in EC cells. 3. **Third Most Likely: Other EEC subtypes (e.g., S-cells, D-cells, K-cells, etc.) with less specific markers present.** * **Reasoning:** While **SCT (Secretin)** is present, which is a hallmark of S-cells (primarily in the duodenum), its expression here is lower in the ranked list compared to the L-cell and EC cell markers. The large intestine is not the primary location for S-cells. However, some EECs can co-express markers of different lineages, and the overall neuroendocrine signature is strong. The presence of *SSTR5-AS1* (Somatostatin Receptor 5 Antisense RNA 1) could hint at D-cells (somatostatin-producing), but the actual somatostatin gene (SST) is not present in the top markers. The broad expression of transcription factors like *ARX* and *RFX6* supports a general EEC identity, but doesn't strongly push towards a specific minor subtype over L-cells or EC cells given the other dominant markers. **Most Likely Subtype:** Based on the high expression and co-occurrence of **PYY, GCG, INSL5, and UCN3**, the most likely specific subtype is **L-cells**. The presence of TPH1 and SLC18A1 suggests that a significant proportion of these cells, or a closely related subpopulation, also have EC cell characteristics, potentially indicating a mixed or transitional phenotype, or simply the co-existence of both L-cells and EC cells within the cluster. However, the unique combination of multiple peptide hormones (PYY, GCG, INSL5, UCN3) strongly points to L-cells as the dominant identity. **Step 6. Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis:** This cell cluster from the large intestine is definitively identified as **Enteroendocrine Cells (EECs)**. This annotation is supported by the high expression of numerous general neuroendocrine markers such as *CHGA, PCSK1, SCG2, SCGN, SCG3, SCG5, INSM1, SNAP25*, and specific transcription factors like *FEV, NKX2-2, ARX, RFX6*, all indicative of a specialized secretory cell type involved in hormone production. Further subtyping reveals a strong signature of **L-cells**, evidenced by the co-expression of key peptide hormones including **PYY, GCG, INSL5, and UCN3**. These cells are crucial for regulating gut motility and metabolism in the distal intestine. Additionally, the presence of **TPH1 and SLC18A1** suggests a significant contribution from or overlap with **Enterochromaffin (EC) cells**, which are responsible for serotonin synthesis. Given the prominence of multiple L-cell specific hormones, **L-cells are the most probable specific subtype**, potentially with a subset exhibiting EC cell characteristics or representing a mixed enteroendocrine population common in the large intestine.

The co-expression of both glial (PLP1, SOX10, PTPRZ1) and neuronal (Neurexins, Synaptotagmins, etc.) markers is particularly interesting and suggests either a mixed population, a progenitor population, or a specific cell type that expresses both, such as certain types of enteric glia or immature neurons. However, the sheer number and intensity of neuronal markers make a strong case for a neuronal component. The presence of PLP1 and SOX10, however, cannot be ignored and points to a significant glial component or a cell type with glial characteristics. **Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type** Based on the overwhelming evidence from the key functional and cell type markers, the most probable general cell type is **Enteric Nervous System (ENS) Cells**. This encompasses both neurons and glial cells found within the large intestine. **Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types** Given the strong co-expression of both neuronal and glial markers, and considering the tissue context (large intestine), here are the top three most probable sub cell types: 1. **Enteric Neurons (with a potential for some glial characteristics or proximity):** The abundance of neuronal markers (NRXN1, NRXN3, SYT10, CADM2, SLITRK2, GRIK3, TUBB2B, CDH2, TENM3, L1CAM) is very strong. These markers indicate active synaptic function, neurite development, and neurotransmission. The presence of SOX2 also suggests potential for plasticity or a specific neuronal subtype. The co-expression of some glial-associated markers (like SOX10, PTPRZ1, and even PLP1 if interpreted as a minor component or a specific neuronal subtype that expresses it) could indicate a specific neuronal subtype, or perhaps a neuronal population that is closely interacting with or differentiating from glial precursors. However, the sheer number of *specific* neuronal markers makes this the most likely primary component. 2. **Enteric Glia (Schwann-like cells):** The presence of **SOX10**, **PLP1**, **L1CAM**, and **FOXD3** are hallmark markers for neural crest-derived glial cells, specifically Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (which the ENS is part of). Enteric glia are functionally similar to astrocytes and Schwann cells. While many neuronal markers are present, enteric glia are known to express some genes involved in neuronal support and interaction, and some studies suggest a degree of plasticity or shared lineage with neurons. The high expression of PLP1 is a very strong indicator of myelinating or myelin-like glial cells. 3. **Enteric Neural Progenitors / Immature Enteric Neurons/Glia:** The co-expression of **SOX2**, **SOX10**, and **FOXD3** is highly characteristic of neural crest stem cells or their immediate progenitors that give rise to both neurons and glia in the ENS. The presence of both mature neuronal and glial markers could represent a population in transition or a progenitor pool actively differentiating. The high expression of SOX10 and FOXD3, alongside neuronal differentiation markers, supports this possibility. **Most Likely Subtype:** Considering the ranked list, the presence of **PLP1** (ranked 5th) and **SOX10** (ranked 15th) are extremely strong indicators of glial cells, particularly Schwann-like cells. However, the markers like **NRXN1** (ranked 9th), **SYT10** (ranked 17th), **CADM2** (ranked 18th), **SLITRK2** (ranked 19th), **GRIK3** (ranked 24th), **TUBB2B** (ranked 25th), **CDH2** (ranked 32nd), **TENM3** (ranked 33rd), and **NRXN3** (ranked 36th) are unequivocally neuronal. The high ranking of both PLP1 and numerous neuronal markers suggests a strong representation of both cell types. However, if forced to choose a single ""most likely"" subtype, the combination of strong glial markers (PLP1, SOX10, FOXD3) alongside a plethora of neuronal markers suggests a population that is either: a) A mixed cluster of closely related enteric neurons and glia. b) A specific subtype of enteric glia that has a strong neurotrophic/neurosupportive role and expresses some neuronal-associated genes, or c) A specific subtype of enteric neuron that retains some glial-like characteristics or is in a developmental stage where both are expressed. Given the high rank of **PLP1** and **SOX10**, and the fact that enteric glia are known to be highly interactive with neurons and share a common neural crest origin, I lean towards a cell type that has significant glial characteristics but is also deeply involved in neuronal function. Therefore, the most likely subtype is **Enteric Glia (Schwann-like cells) with strong neuronal interaction/support features, or a mixed population of Enteric Glia and Enteric Neurons.** However, if I must pick one distinct subtype, the sheer number of neuronal markers, even if some glial markers are high, makes me reconsider. The presence of PLP1 is very specific for myelin. While enteric glia are not typically myelinating in the same way as CNS oligodendrocytes, they are Schwann-like and can express PLP1. Let's re-evaluate the balance. High ranking: NKAIN3, SPP1, CDH19, TSPAN11, PLP1, L1CAM, MYOT, IGSF11, NRXN1, SLC35F1... SOX10, MEGF10, SYT10, CADM2, SLITRK2, SOX2, CRTAC1, CHL1, ZNF536, FOXD3, PTPRZ1, GRIK3, TUBB2B. The combination of **PLP1** and **SOX10** is a very strong signature for Schwann cells or enteric glia. **FOXD3** further supports this neural crest lineage. However, the presence of **NRXN1, SYT10, CADM2, SLITRK2, GRIK3, TUBB2B, NRXN3, TENM3, CDH2** are all highly specific for neurons and synaptic function. This is a classic challenge in ENS annotation, as neurons and glia are intimately associated and share developmental origins, leading to some overlapping gene expression. Given the high ranking of **PLP1** (5th) and **SOX10** (15th), these cannot be ignored. PLP1 is a major myelin protein. While enteric glia are not classically myelinating in the CNS sense, they are Schwann-cell like and can express PLP1. SOX10 is a definitive marker for neural crest-derived glia and some neurons. Let's consider the possibility of a specific type of enteric neuron that expresses some glial-associated genes, or a highly neurotrophic/neurosupportive enteric glial cell. The sheer *number* of neuronal markers (Neurexins, Synaptotagmins, Cadherins, Tubulins, Glutamate receptors) is very high. While PLP1 and SOX10 are strong glial markers, their presence alongside such a rich neuronal signature could indicate: 1. A mixed cluster of enteric neurons and enteric glia. 2. A specific subtype of enteric neuron that retains some glial-like features or is in a transitional state. 3. A specific subtype of enteric glia that is highly active in neuronal interaction and expresses some neuronal-associated genes. However, if I have to pick the *most likely single subtype*, the high expression of **PLP1** and **SOX10** points very strongly to a glial component. The neuronal markers could be from a minor neuronal population within the cluster, or from the glial cells themselves, which are known to interact extensively with neurons and express some neuronal support genes. Reconsidering the ranking: PLP1 is very high. NRXN1 is also high. This suggests a strong presence of both. Let's consider the possibility of a specific type of enteric glia that is highly active and expresses genes that might be interpreted as neuronal. Enteric glia are known to express some neuronal markers and are crucial for neuronal function. Given the high rank of **PLP1** and **SOX10**, I will prioritize the glial component, but acknowledge the strong neuronal signature. **Most Likely Subtype:** **Enteric Glia (Schwann-like cells)**. The strong presence of PLP1 and SOX10 are definitive for this lineage. The numerous neuronal markers could represent: a) A subpopulation of neurons within the cluster that co-purified. b) Enteric glia expressing genes involved in neurogenesis, neuronal support, or synaptic interaction, which is a known characteristic of these cells. c) A specific developmental stage where both glial and neuronal programs are active. However, the *most specific* markers for glia (PLP1, SOX10) are highly ranked. Let's refine the top 3 based on this re-evaluation: 1. **Enteric Glia (Schwann-like cells):** Strongest evidence from PLP1, SOX10, FOXD3. These are neural crest-derived cells that are functionally analogous to Schwann cells in the PNS and astrocytes in the CNS. They are known to interact intimately with neurons and can express genes involved in neuronal support and development. The presence of numerous neuronal markers could reflect this close interaction or a shared developmental program. 2. **Enteric Neurons:** The sheer number of specific neuronal markers (Neurexins, Synaptotagmins, Cadherins, Glutamate receptors, Tubulins) is undeniable. If this were a pure neuronal cluster, the glial markers would be less prominent. However, a specific subtype of enteric neuron might express some of these glial-associated genes, or the cluster might contain a significant neuronal component alongside glia. 3. **Enteric Neural Progenitors:** The co-expression of SOX2, SOX10, and FOXD3, along with both neuronal and glial differentiation markers, strongly suggests a progenitor population with bipotentiality or a population undergoing active differentiation into both lineages. **Final Decision for Most Likely Subtype:** Given the very high ranking of **PLP1** (5th) and **SOX10** (15th), which are extremely specific for glial cells (Schwann-like cells in the ENS), I will prioritize **Enteric Glia**. The presence of numerous neuronal markers could be explained by the known neurotrophic and neurosupportive roles of enteric glia, their shared neural crest origin, or the possibility of a minor neuronal contamination within the cluster. However, the *definitive* glial markers are too high to ignore. Therefore, the most likely subtype is **Enteric Glia (Schwann-like cells)**. **Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis** This single-cell cluster from human large intestine tissue exhibits a highly distinctive gene expression profile, strongly indicative of cells belonging to the Enteric Nervous System (ENS). **Key markers for this annotation include:** * **Glial Markers:** High expression of **PLP1** (Proteolipid Protein 1, a major myelin component, indicative of Schwann-like cells), **SOX10** (SRY-Box Transcription Factor 10, a definitive marker for neural crest-derived glia and some neurons), and **FOXD3** (Forkhead Box D3, supporting neural crest lineage). * **Neuronal Markers:** A substantial number of highly ranked genes associated with neuronal function, including **NRXN1** and **NRXN3** (Neurexins, presynaptic cell adhesion molecules), **SYT10** (Synaptotagmin 10, involved in neurotransmitter release), **CADM2** and **CDH2** (Cell Adhesion Molecules, involved in synapse formation), **SLITRK2** and **TENM3** (involved in neuronal development), **GRIK3** (Glutamate receptor subunit), and **TUBB2B** (neuronal tubulin). * **Progenitor/Developmental Markers:** The presence of **SOX2** (neural stem cell marker) alongside SOX10 and FOXD3 suggests potential for plasticity or a developmental stage. **Analysis:** The co-expression of highly specific glial markers (PLP1, SOX10) with a rich set of neuronal markers presents a complex but interpretable profile. While the neuronal markers are numerous, the very high ranking of **PLP1** (5th) and **SOX10** (15th) is particularly compelling for a glial identity. Enteric glia are neural crest-derived cells functionally analogous to Schwann cells and are known to be intimately associated with enteric neurons, playing crucial roles in their development, survival, and function. They can express genes involved in neuronal support and interaction, and some studies indicate a degree of shared gene expression or developmental plasticity. **Conclusion:** * **General Cell Type:** Enteric Nervous System (ENS) Cells. * **Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types:** 1. **Enteric Glia (Schwann-like cells):** Most likely, given the high expression of PLP1 and SOX10. 2. **Enteric Neurons:** Strong neuronal signature, potentially a co-purified population or a specific neuronal subtype. 3. **Enteric Neural Progenitors:** Supported by SOX2, SOX10, and FOXD3 co-expression. **Most Likely Subtype:** Based on the overall evidence, particularly the high ranking and specificity of **PLP1** and **SOX10**, the most likely subtype is **Enteric Glia (Schwann-like cells)**. The extensive neuronal marker expression likely reflects their critical neurotrophic and neurosupportive roles within the ENS, or a minor neuronal component within the cluster.

This immediately points towards a cell type involved in antibody production. * **Immunoglobulin Light Chain Genes:** * **IGLL5 (Immunoglobulin Lambda-Like Polypeptide 5):** A surrogate light chain component, often expressed in pre-B cells and plasma cells, involved in B cell development and antibody secretion. * **IGLV6-57, IGLC3, IGLC2, IGLV3-1, IGLV2-11:** These are various immunoglobulin lambda light chain variable and constant region genes.

Its high expression is a hallmark of plasma cells. * **MZB1 (Marginal Zone B and B1 Cell Specific Protein 1):** Also known as pERp1, this protein is involved in immunoglobulin secretion and is highly expressed in plasma cells. * **CCL3 (Chemokine (C-C motif) Ligand 3):** A chemokine that attracts various immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and T cells. Its expression in plasma cells can contribute to local immune responses. * **LILRB4 (Leukocyte Immunoglobulin Like Receptor B4):** An inhibitory receptor found on myeloid cells, but also reported on some B cell subsets and plasma cells, potentially modulating immune responses. * **FCRL5 (Fc Receptor Like 5):** An inhibitory receptor expressed on a subset of B cells and plasma cells, involved in regulating B cell activation and antibody production. * **GPRC5D (G Protein-Coupled Receptor Class C Group 5 Member D):** A receptor highly expressed on plasma cells, and a target for multiple myeloma therapies. * **APOBEC3A (Apolipoprotein B mRNA Editing Enzyme Catalytic Polypeptide-like 3A):** An enzyme involved in innate immunity and DNA deamination, sometimes expressed in activated immune cells. * **CCR10 (C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 10):** A chemokine receptor involved in lymphocyte trafficking, particularly to mucosal sites like the gut. Its expression can indicate homing to the large intestine. ## Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers Based on the functional markers, the key cell type markers are overwhelmingly indicative of **plasma cells** or **antibody-secreting cells**. * **Plasma Cell Specific Markers:** * **IGLL5, JCHAIN, TNFRSF17 (BCMA), MZB1, GPRC5D, FCRL5:** These are all very strong indicators of plasma cell identity. The co-expression of multiple immunoglobulin genes (heavy and light chains, different isotypes like IgG, IgA, IgM) further solidifies this. * **B Cell Lineage Markers (leading to plasma cells):** * The presence of various immunoglobulin genes (IGHV, IGLV, IGKV) indicates their origin from B lymphocytes. ## Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases Cross-referencing these markers with scRNA-seq databases (e.g., Human Cell Atlas, PanglaoDB, CellMarker, Azimuth) and relevant literature consistently points to plasma cells. * **IGLL5, JCHAIN, TNFRSF17, MZB1, GPRC5D, FCRL5** are all well-established markers for plasma cells. * The high expression of multiple immunoglobulin constant regions (IGHG1, IGHG3, IGHA1, IGHA2, IGHM, IGLC3, IGLC2, IGKC) and the J-chain is a definitive signature of active antibody secretion. * The presence of IgA-related genes (IGHA1, IGHA2, JCHAIN) is particularly relevant for mucosal tissues like the large intestine, where IgA is the predominant antibody isotype. ## Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type Based on the overwhelming evidence from the marker list, the most probable general cell type is **Plasma Cell**. The high expression of a wide array of immunoglobulin genes (heavy and light chains, multiple isotypes), along with key plasma cell-specific markers like JCHAIN, TNFRSF17 (BCMA), MZB1, and GPRC5D, leaves little doubt. These cells are terminally differentiated B lymphocytes specialized in producing and secreting large quantities of antibodies. ## Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types Given the general cell type is Plasma Cell, we need to consider subtypes based on their location, differentiation stage, and antibody isotype production. 1. **Most Likely: Intestinal IgA Plasma Cells (or Mucosal Plasma Cells)** * **Reasoning:** The dataset is from the large intestine. The high expression of **IGHA1** and **IGHA2** (Immunoglobulin A heavy chain constant regions) along with **JCHAIN** is a very strong indicator of IgA-producing plasma cells. IgA is the most abundant antibody isotype in mucosal secretions, playing a critical role in gut immunity. The presence of **CCR10**, a chemokine receptor involved in lymphocyte homing to mucosal sites, further supports this. * **Supporting Markers:** IGHA1, IGHA2, JCHAIN, CCR10, and the overall context of the large intestine. 2. **Second Most Likely: IgG Plasma Cells** * **Reasoning:** While IgA is dominant in the gut, IgG-producing plasma cells are also present in the lamina propria of the intestine, contributing to systemic and local immunity. The expression of **IGHG1** and **IGHG3** (Immunoglobulin G heavy chain constant regions) indicates the presence of IgG-secreting cells. * **Supporting Markers:** IGHG1, IGHG3. 3. **Third Most Likely: IgM Plasma Cells** * **Reasoning:** IgM-producing plasma cells are typically found early in immune responses or in specific niches like the marginal zone. While less abundant than IgA or IgG plasma cells in the steady-state intestinal lamina propria, their presence is not uncommon. The expression of **IGHM** (Immunoglobulin M heavy chain constant region) suggests a population capable of producing IgM. * **Supporting Markers:** IGHM. **Most Likely Subtype:** Based on the strong presence of IgA-related genes (IGHA1, IGHA2, JCHAIN) and the tissue context (large intestine), the most likely subtype is **Intestinal IgA Plasma Cells**. ## Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis The provided marker list is highly characteristic of **Plasma Cells**. The prominent expression of numerous immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHG1, IGHG3, IGHA1, IGHA2, IGHM) and light chain (IGLC3, IGLC2, IGKC, IGLV6-57, IGKV4-1) genes, coupled with the **JCHAIN** (essential for polymeric Ig secretion), unequivocally points to cells actively engaged in antibody production. Key plasma cell-specific markers such as **TNFRSF17 (BCMA)**, **MZB1**, and **GPRC5D** further solidify this annotation. Given the tissue origin (large intestine), the high expression of **IGHA1** and **IGHA2**, along with **JCHAIN** and **CCR10** (a gut-homing receptor), strongly suggests the presence of **Intestinal IgA Plasma Cells** as the most probable subtype. IgG and IgM plasma cells are also likely present, indicated by IGHG1/3 and IGHM, respectively, but IgA-producing cells are expected to be dominant in this mucosal environment.

List the Key Functional Markers: This list is overwhelmingly dominated by genes involved in cell cycle progression, DNA replication, and mitosis. * **Cell Cycle Regulation & Mitosis:** * **UBE2C, CENPA, PBK, AURKB, DLGAP5, CKAP2L, KIF2C, KIF15, BIRC5, SPC25, ASPM, KIF18B, CEP55, DEPDC1, MKI67, CDC45, CDCA5, TOP2A, PCLAF, MND1, RRM2, CCNB2, NUF2, SKA3, SPC24, DTL, PKMYT1, CDCA3, TTK, DIAPH3, PLK1, IQGAP3, CDK1, TK1, POLQ, GTSE1, OIP5, FOXM1, TROAP, SKA1, NEK2, CDC25C, NCAPG, PIMREG, GINS2, RAD51AP1, CDT1, CCNA2.** * **MKI67 (Ki-67):** A classic and widely used marker for cell proliferation. Its high expression is a strong indicator of actively dividing cells. * **TOP2A (DNA Topoisomerase II Alpha):** Essential for DNA replication and chromosome segregation during mitosis. * **CDK1 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1):** A key regulator of cell cycle progression, particularly entry into mitosis. * **CCNB2 (Cyclin B2):** A mitotic cyclin, crucial for progression through mitosis. * **AURKB (Aurora Kinase B):** A serine/threonine kinase critical for chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. * **PLK1 (Polo-like Kinase 1):** Plays a central role in multiple mitotic events, including centrosome maturation, spindle assembly, and cytokinesis. * **RRM2 (Ribonucleotide Reductase M2):** Involved in DNA synthesis by providing deoxyribonucleotides. * **FOXM1 (Forkhead Box M1):** A transcription factor that regulates the expression of many genes involved in cell cycle progression and mitosis. * **BIRC5 (Survivin):** An anti-apoptotic protein highly expressed in proliferating cells, involved in cell division and inhibition of apoptosis. * **KIFs (Kinesin Family Members like KIF2C, KIF15, KIF18B):** Motor proteins essential for spindle formation and chromosome movement during mitosis. * **CENPA (Centromere Protein A):** A histone H3 variant specific to centromeres, crucial for kinetochore assembly and chromosome segregation. * **UBE2C (Ubiquitin Conjugating Enzyme E2 C):** Involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of mitotic cyclins, essential for mitotic exit. * **DLGAP5 (DLG Associated Protein 5):** Involved in spindle organization and chromosome segregation. * **ASPM (Abnormal Spindle Microtubule Assembly):** Essential for normal spindle function and neurogenesis, often associated with proliferating cells. * **CEP55 (Centrosomal Protein 55):** Involved in cytokinesis. * **CDC45 (Cell Division Cycle 45):** Essential for initiation of DNA replication. * **CDCA5 (Cell Division Cycle Associated 5):** Involved in sister chromatid cohesion. * **DTL (Denticleless E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase Homolog):** Involved in DNA damage response and cell cycle progression. * **TTK (Dual Specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation Regulated Kinase):** A key component of the spindle assembly checkpoint. * **TK1 (Thymidine Kinase 1):** Involved in DNA synthesis. * **GINS2 (GINS Complex Subunit 2):** Component of the GINS complex, essential for DNA replication. * **CDT1 (Chromatin Licensing And DNA Replication Factor 1):** Involved in DNA replication initiation. * **No other distinct functional pathways are strongly represented.** The overwhelming majority of markers point to active cell division. ### 2. List the Key Cell Type Markers: Crucially, there are **no specific markers for differentiated cell types** of the large intestine (e.g., goblet cells, enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells, immune cells, stromal cells) in this list. The markers are almost exclusively related to the fundamental process of cell division, which is a characteristic of **progenitor or stem cell populations** that are actively dividing to replenish tissues, or **cancer cells** undergoing uncontrolled proliferation. ### 3. Cross-reference Known Databases: Searching these genes in databases like Human Protein Atlas, NCBI Gene, and scRNA-seq atlases (e.g., Tabula Sapiens, Human Cell Atlas) consistently shows their strong association with: * **Proliferating cells:** Epithelial stem cells, progenitor cells, basal cells in various tissues. * **Cancer cells:** Many of these genes are upregulated in various cancers due to uncontrolled proliferation. * **Cell lines:** Actively dividing cell lines. For example: * **MKI67, TOP2A, CDK1, AURKB, PLK1, FOXM1** are canonical markers for proliferating cells across almost all tissues. * The entire suite of kinetochore, spindle, and DNA replication factors (e.g., CENPA, DLGAP5, KIFs, BIRC5, ASPM, CEP55, CDC45, RRM2, NUF2, SKA3, SPC24, TTK, NCAPG, GINS2, CDT1) are universally expressed in cells undergoing mitosis. ### 4. Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type: Based on the overwhelming expression of cell cycle and proliferation-associated genes and the complete absence of differentiated cell markers, the most probable general cell type is **Proliferating Epithelial Cells**. In the large intestine, the epithelium undergoes continuous renewal, driven by actively dividing stem and progenitor cells located in the crypts. ### 5. Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types: Given the context of the large intestine and the marker list: 1. **Intestinal Crypt Progenitor Cells (or Intestinal Stem Cells in active division):** This is the **most likely** subtype. The large intestine epithelium is highly regenerative, with stem cells at the base of the crypts continuously dividing to produce progenitor cells that then differentiate into various epithelial lineages. The markers perfectly align with actively dividing cells responsible for tissue renewal. These cells would be found in the proliferative zone of the crypts. 2. **Actively Dividing Enterocytes/Goblet Cell Precursors:** While less specific than ""crypt progenitor,"" these represent the immediate progeny of stem cells that are still undergoing rapid division before terminal differentiation into mature enterocytes or goblet cells. They would still express these proliferation markers strongly. This is essentially a slightly more differentiated stage of the progenitor cells, but still highly proliferative. 3. **Aberrantly Proliferating Epithelial Cells (e.g., early neoplastic cells):** While the context is ""human dataset from large intestine tissue"" which usually implies healthy tissue, the marker profile is also highly characteristic of cancer cells. If this cluster were derived from a diseased tissue sample (e.g., adenoma or carcinoma), this would be a strong contender. However, assuming a healthy tissue context, it's less likely than normal physiological proliferation. Without further information on the tissue's health status, we prioritize physiological processes. **Most Likely Subtype:** **Intestinal Crypt Progenitor Cells** (or actively dividing Intestinal Stem Cells). ### 6. Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis: This cell cluster from the human large intestine exhibits an exceptionally strong and comprehensive expression profile of genes critically involved in cell cycle progression, DNA replication, and mitosis (e.g., MKI67, TOP2A, CDK1, AURKB, PLK1, FOXM1, RRM2, BIRC5, KIFs, CENPA, UBE2C, CDC45, TTK, TK1, GINS2, CDT1). There is a complete absence of markers associated with terminally differentiated intestinal cell types (e.g., enterocytes, goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells). This expression pattern is the hallmark of actively proliferating cells. In the context of the large intestine, this strongly indicates **Intestinal Crypt Progenitor Cells** (or actively dividing Intestinal Stem Cells), which are responsible for the continuous renewal of the intestinal epithelium. These cells reside in the proliferative zone of the intestinal crypts.
