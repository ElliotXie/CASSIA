## USER


You are a careful senior computational biologist called in whenever an annotation needs deeper scrutiny, disambiguation, or simply a second opinion. Your job is to (1) assess the current annotation's robustness and (2) propose up to three decisive follow‑up checks that the executor can run (e.g., examine expression of key positive or negative markers). You should do a good job or 10 grandma are going to be in danger. You never rush to conclusions and are always careful.

Prior annotation results：
 Here is a summary of the prior cell type annotation analysis:

**Previously Identified Cell Type**: Plasma Cell, specifically IgA-secreting Plasma Cells (Mucosal Plasma Cells).

**Key Supporting Markers**: The identification was primarily supported by the overwhelming presence of immunoglobulin genes (IGHV, IGHG1, IGHG3, IGHM, IGHA1, IGHA2, IGLV, IGLC, IGKV, IGKC), indicating active and diverse antibody production. Crucially, **JCHAIN** (essential for polymeric IgA/IgM secretion), **TNFRSF17 (BCMA)**, **MZB1**, and **GPRC5D** were definitive markers of terminally differentiated plasma cells. The prominent expression of **IGHA1** and **IGHA2**, along with **CCR10**, strongly indicated IgA-secreting mucosal plasma cells.

**Alternative Hypotheses**: No explicit alternative cell types were considered as the primary identification. However, within the plasma cell lineage, IgG-secreting and IgM-secreting plasma cells were considered as less likely subtypes due to the dominance of IgA-related markers.

**Remaining Uncertainties**: The presence of **MYL2** (Myosin Light Chain 2), typically associated with muscle cells, was noted as unusual for an immune cell and might indicate contamination, doublets, or a less common regulatory role, though it was considered a minor or non-specific signal given the overwhelming immune signature. The functional significance of several uncharacterized genes, predicted genes, and lncRNAs (e.g., FAM92B, AC026369.3) was not fully elucidated.

What you should do:

1. Brief Evaluation – One concise paragraph that:

    - Highlights strengths, ambiguities, or contradictions in the current call.

    - Notes if a mixed population, doublets, or transitional state might explain the data.

2. Design up to 3 follow‑up checks (cell types or biological hypotheses):

    - When listing genes for follow-up checks, use the <check_genes>...</check_genes> tags.
    - **CRITICAL FORMATTING FOR <check_genes>:**
        - Inside the tags, provide *ONLY* a comma-separated list of official HGNC gene symbols.
        - Example: `<check_genes>GENE1,GENE2,GENE3</check_genes>` (no extra spaces, no newlines within the list, no numbering or commentary *inside* the tags).
        - Strict adherence to this format is ESSENTIAL for the analysis to proceed.
    - Include both positive and negative markers if that will clarify the call.

    - Including reasoning: why these genes, and what pattern would confirm or refute the hypothesis.

3. Upon receiving gene expression results, based on the current hypothesis, further your analysis, genearte new hypothesis to validate if you think necessary. Continue Step 2 iteratively until the cluster is confidently annotated. Once finalized, output the single line:
"FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED"
Then provide a conclusion paragraph that includes:

1.The final cell type
2.Confidence level (high, medium, or low)
3.Key markers supporting your conclusion
4.Alternative possibilities only if the confidence is not high, and what should the user do next.

Evaluation
The prior annotation strongly points towards IgA-secreting plasma cells, supported by a robust set of immunoglobulin genes, JCHAIN, TNFRSF17, MZB1, GPRC5D, and IgA-specific markers like IGHA1, IGHA2, and CCR10. This is a compelling case. However, the presence of MYL2 is indeed anomalous for a plasma cell and warrants further investigation, as it could indicate a doublet with a muscle cell or a distinct, less common cell state. The high ranking of several uncharacterized genes and lncRNAs also suggests potential for deeper understanding or overlooked cell states.

hypothesis to check 1: Doublet with smooth muscle cell

<check_genes>MYL2,ACTA2,MYH11,PTPRC,CD3E,CD19</check_genes>

<reasoning>
Given the unexpected presence of MYL2, a common marker for smooth muscle cells, it is crucial to investigate if this cluster represents doublets between plasma cells and smooth muscle cells. We would expect to see co-expression of smooth muscle markers (ACTA2, MYH11) alongside plasma cell markers (which are already highly expressed). Conversely, we should check for the absence of pan-leukocyte (PTPRC) or pan-T/B cell markers (CD3E, CD19) in cells expressing high levels of MYL2, which would argue against a pure immune cell population. If ACTA2 and MYH11 are also highly expressed, it would strongly support a doublet hypothesis.
</reasoning>

celltype to check 2: IgG-secreting Plasma Cells

<check_genes>IGHG1,IGHG2,IGHG3,IGHG4,IGHA1,IGHA2</check_genes>

<reasoning>
While the prior annotation noted the dominance of IgA markers, IGHG1 and IGHG3 are present in the top markers. To definitively rule out a significant IgG-secreting plasma cell component, or to identify a mixed population, we should examine the relative expression levels of all IgG constant heavy chain genes (IGHG1, IGHG2, IGHG3, IGHG4) compared to IgA constant heavy chain genes (IGHA1, IGHA2). If IgG genes show comparable or higher expression than currently perceived, it might indicate a more mixed population of IgA and IgG plasma cells, or even a dominant IgG population if the IgA markers are less specific than assumed.
</reasoning>

hypothesis to check 3: Contamination by myeloid cells

<check_genes>LILRB4,CCL3,CD14,CD68,FCGR3A,CD163</check_genes>

<reasoning>
LILRB4 and CCL3 are present in the marker list, which can be associated with certain myeloid cell types, including monocytes or macrophages. While not highly ranked, their presence warrants a check for potential myeloid contamination or a rare myeloid-plasma cell hybrid. We should examine the expression of canonical myeloid markers such as CD14, CD68, FCGR3A (CD16), and CD163. If these markers are co-expressed with plasma cell markers, it could indicate a mixed population or a specific interaction. If they are expressed in a distinct subpopulation, it might suggest contamination.

## ASSISTANT

Evaluation
The previous checks were designed to address potential doublets, alternative plasma cell subtypes, and myeloid contamination. However, the provided gene expression results indicate that none of the proposed genes were found in the differential expression list. This severely limits our ability to confirm or refute the prior hypotheses and suggests that the initial marker list might be incomplete or that the differential expression analysis was performed with a restrictive threshold. The core annotation of IgA-secreting plasma cells remains compelling based on the initial strong immunoglobulin signature, but the lack of data for key confirmatory or exclusionary markers prevents a definitive conclusion on the robustness of the initial assessment or the nature of the MYL2 signal.

celltype to check 1: IgA-secreting Plasma Cells (Re-validation of core identity)

<check_genes>JCHAIN,TNFRSF17,MZB1,GPRC5D,IGHA1,IGHA2,CCR10</check_genes>

<reasoning>
Given the absence of data for the previously requested genes, we must first re-validate the core identity of the cluster as IgA-secreting plasma cells using the markers that were initially cited as definitive. We need to confirm the expression levels of JCHAIN, TNFRSF17, MZB1, GPRC5D, IGHA1, IGHA2, and CCR10. High and specific expression of these genes would strongly support the initial annotation. If any of these core markers are not highly expressed, it would cast doubt on the initial call and necessitate a broader re-evaluation.
</reasoning>

hypothesis to check 2: Doublet or Contamination (Re-evaluation of MYL2)

<check_genes>MYL2,ACTA2,MYH11,CDH5,PECAM1,PTPRC,CD19</check_genes>

<reasoning>
The presence of MYL2 remains an unresolved anomaly. Since the previous check for smooth muscle markers was inconclusive due to missing data, we need to re-examine MYL2 in the context of broader muscle cell types and endothelial cells (as muscle cells are often associated with vasculature). We will check for MYL2 alongside smooth muscle markers (ACTA2, MYH11) and endothelial markers (CDH5, PECAM1). Additionally, we will re-include pan-leukocyte (PTPRC) and B cell (CD19) markers to assess if MYL2 is expressed in a distinct population or co-expressed with immune markers, which would help distinguish between contamination/doublets and a potential rare immune cell state.
</reasoning>

hypothesis to check 3: Uncharacterized Ig-related Cell State

<check_genes>FAM92B,AC026369.3,LINC02362,AL391056.1,TXNDC5,DERL3,UBE2QL1</check_genes>

<reasoning>
Several uncharacterized genes, predicted genes, and lncRNAs (e.g., FAM92B, AC026369.3, LINC02362, AL391056.1) were noted as highly expressed. While their functional significance is unknown, their consistent high ranking suggests they might be specific to this cell state or a subpopulation within it. We should investigate their expression patterns. If these genes are highly co-expressed with the core plasma cell markers, it might indicate a specific functional state or a novel subpopulation of plasma cells. If they are expressed in a distinct subset of cells, it could point to a previously uncharacterized cell type or a transitional state. TXNDC5, DERL3, and UBE2QL1 are also highly ranked and have roles in protein folding and degradation, which are highly active in antibody-secreting cells, making their specific expression patterns of interest.

## ASSISTANT

Evaluation
The repeated absence of key genes from the differential expression list, including core plasma cell markers (JCHAIN, TNFRSF17, MZB1, GPRC5D, IGHA1, IGHA2, CCR10), the anomalous MYL2, and the highly ranked uncharacterized genes, makes it impossible to confidently evaluate the initial annotation or any subsequent hypotheses. Without expression data for these critical markers, any conclusion would be speculative and lack empirical support. It is imperative to obtain the expression data for these genes to proceed with a robust annotation.

FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED
The current marker information is insufficient to make a confident conclusion. The user should provide the expression data for the requested genes to allow for a proper analysis.
