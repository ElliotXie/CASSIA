B cells,Activated B Lymphocytes,"Activated B cells / Antigen-Presenting B cells, Germinal Center B cells, Memory B cells",,15,"HLA-DQA1, CCT7, GUCD1, ARL2BP, ARPC5L, SNRPB, FAM96B, ACP1, RALY, IDH2, FERMT3, CD79A, FBXO7, IL16, HDAC1",1,google/gemini-2.5-flash,openrouter,large intestine,human,N/A,"Final Annotation Agent: Okay, I will meticulously analyze the provided list of highly expressed markers from a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from human large intestine tissue. I will follow the outlined steps to identify the cell type, providing a comprehensive and specific analysis for an expert audience. **Marker List:** HLA-DQA1, CCT7, GUCD1, ARL2BP, ARPC5L, SNRPB, FAM96B, ACP1, RALY, IDH2, FERMT3, CD79A, FBXO7, IL16, HDAC1 --- **Step 1: List the Key Functional Markers** This step focuses on genes that indicate cellular processes, pathways, or general cellular states rather than specific cell identities. * **CCT7 (Chaperonin Containing TCP1 Subunit 7):** Part of the chaperonin containing TCP1 (CCT) complex, which is involved in the folding of newly synthesized proteins, particularly actin and tubulin. This indicates active protein synthesis and cellular maintenance. * **GUCD1 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor For Rab32 And Rab38):** Involved in membrane trafficking and organelle biogenesis. Its presence suggests active intracellular transport and potentially lysosomal or melanosomal functions. * **ARL2BP (ADP-Ribosylation Factor Like 2 Binding Protein):** Interacts with ARL2, a small GTPase involved in microtubule dynamics and mitochondrial integrity. Suggests active cytoskeletal remodeling and mitochondrial function. * **ARPC5L (Actin Related Protein 2/3 Complex Subunit 5 Like):** A component of the Arp2/3 complex, which is critical for actin nucleation and branching, driving cell motility, endocytosis, and membrane protrusion. This strongly points towards cells with active cytoskeletal dynamics, such as immune cells, fibroblasts, or epithelial cells undergoing migration/remodeling. * **SNRPB (Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Polypeptide B):** A core component of the spliceosome, essential for pre-mRNA splicing. Indicates active gene expression and RNA processing, a general feature of all metabolically active cells. * **FAM96B (Family With Sequence Similarity 96 Member B):** Its precise function is less well-characterized, but it has been implicated in various cellular processes, potentially related to protein modification or degradation. * **ACP1 (Acid Phosphatase 1):** A cytosolic enzyme involved in dephosphorylation reactions. While broadly expressed, it can be enriched in certain cell types and involved in various metabolic processes. * **RALY (RNA Binding Protein, RALY):** An RNA-binding protein involved in mRNA processing and stability. Another general indicator of active gene expression. * **IDH2 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 2):** A mitochondrial enzyme involved in the citric acid cycle and NADPH production. Indicates active mitochondrial metabolism and energy production. * **FBXO7 (F-Box Protein 7):** A component of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complexes, involved in protein ubiquitination and degradation. Suggests active protein turnover and regulation of cell cycle or signaling pathways. * **HDAC1 (Histone Deacetylase 1):** A histone deacetylase involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. Indicates active transcriptional control. **Summary of Functional Markers:** The functional markers indicate a metabolically active cell with robust protein synthesis, processing, degradation, active cytoskeletal dynamics (especially actin remodeling), and active gene expression regulation. The presence of ARPC5L is particularly notable for cells with dynamic actin structures. --- **Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers** This step focuses on genes known to be specific or highly enriched in particular cell types. * **HLA-DQA1 (Major Histocompatibility Complex, Class II, DQ Alpha 1):** This is a crucial marker. HLA-DQA1 is a component of the MHC Class II complex, which is expressed on the surface of **antigen-presenting cells (APCs)**. Its primary role is to present exogenous antigens to CD4+ T lymphocytes, initiating adaptive immune responses. This strongly points towards an immune cell lineage, specifically professional APCs. * **FERMT3 (Fermitin Family Member 3, also known as Kindlin-3):** This is another highly significant marker. FERMT3 is a hematopoietic-specific focal adhesion protein that plays a critical role in integrin activation. It is predominantly expressed in **hematopoietic cells**, particularly **myeloid cells (macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells)** and **megakaryocytes/platelets**, where it is essential for cell adhesion, migration, and immune synapse formation. Its presence, especially alongside HLA-DQA1, strongly reinforces an immune cell identity, leaning towards myeloid lineages. * **CD79A (CD79a Molecule):** This is a definitive marker. CD79A (also known as Igα) is a component of the B cell receptor (BCR) complex, expressed exclusively on **B lymphocytes** and their precursors. It is essential for BCR signaling and B cell development. The presence of CD79A is a strong indicator of a B cell lineage. * **IL16 (Interleukin 16):** A pleiotropic cytokine that acts as a chemoattractant for CD4+ T cells, monocytes, and eosinophils. It is produced by various immune cells, including T cells, B cells, macrophages, and mast cells. While not exclusively defining one cell type, its presence is consistent with an immune cell, particularly one involved in immune signaling and recruitment. **Summary of Cell Type Markers:** The combination of **HLA-DQA1**, **FERMT3**, and **CD79A** is highly informative. * **HLA-DQA1** indicates an antigen-presenting cell. * **FERMT3** points to hematopoietic cells, particularly myeloid or megakaryocytic lineages, but also found in some lymphoid cells. * **CD79A** is a definitive marker for B lymphocytes. The co-expression of these markers is somewhat unusual if taken at face value for a single, terminally differentiated cell type. However, it's crucial to consider the context of single-cell data, where expression can be dynamic or reflect specific states. --- **Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases and Literature** Let's cross-reference these markers, especially the key cell type markers, with known expression patterns in the large intestine and general immunology. * **HLA-DQA1:** Widely expressed on professional APCs in the large intestine, including dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. * **FERMT3:** Expressed in various immune cells in the large intestine lamina propria, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. It's crucial for integrin function in these cells. * **CD79A:** Exclusively expressed on B cells. B cells are abundant in the large intestine, particularly in Peyer's patches, isolated lymphoid follicles, and scattered throughout the lamina propria. They play a critical role in mucosal immunity, including IgA production. * **IL16:** Produced by various immune cells in the gut, contributing to immune regulation and inflammation. **The critical observation here is the co-expression of HLA-DQA1, FERMT3, and CD79A.** * **B cells** express CD79A and HLA-DQA1 (as they are professional APCs). * **B cells** also express FERMT3 (Kindlin-3) which is important for their adhesion and migration, especially in germinal centers and during immune responses. Therefore, the combination of these three markers strongly points towards **B lymphocytes**. The other markers (CCT7, GUCD1, ARL2BP, ARPC5L, SNRPB, FAM96B, ACP1, RALY, IDH2, FBXO7, HDAC1) are more general ""housekeeping"" or functional genes that would be expected in any metabolically active immune cell, including B cells. ARPC5L, indicating active actin remodeling, is consistent with B cell activities like antigen presentation, migration, and immune synapse formation. --- **Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type** Based on the strong and specific expression of **CD79A**, coupled with **HLA-DQA1** and **FERMT3**, the most probable general cell type is **B Lymphocytes (B cells)**. * CD79A is the most definitive marker for B cells. * HLA-DQA1 confirms their antigen-presenting capacity. * FERMT3 supports their hematopoietic origin and functional integrin activity. --- **Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types** Given the general identification of B cells, we need to consider different states or subtypes of B cells that might be highly active in the large intestine. The markers provided do not offer extremely fine-grained resolution for B cell subsets (e.g., specific transcription factors for follicular vs. marginal zone B cells, or plasma cell markers like CD138/SDC1). However, we can infer based on the context of the large intestine and the general activity suggested by the functional markers. 1. **Most Likely: Activated B cells / Antigen-Presenting B cells:** * **Reasoning:** The high expression of **HLA-DQA1** is key here. While all B cells can express MHC Class II, its high ranking suggests an active role in antigen presentation. This is characteristic of B cells that have encountered antigen, are undergoing activation, or are resident in lymphoid structures where they actively present antigens to T cells. The active cytoskeletal remodeling (ARPC5L) and general metabolic activity (CCT7, IDH2, etc.) are consistent with an activated state. * **Supporting Markers:** HLA-DQA1, CD79A, FERMT3, ARPC5L. 2. **Second Most Likely: Germinal Center B cells or B cells in lymphoid follicles:** * **Reasoning:** The large intestine contains numerous lymphoid follicles (Peyer's patches, isolated lymphoid follicles) where B cells undergo germinal center reactions, affinity maturation, and class switching. These cells are highly active, proliferate rapidly, and interact extensively with T cells and follicular dendritic cells. They would express high levels of MHC Class II (HLA-DQA1) for T cell help. FERMT3 is also crucial for B cell adhesion and migration within germinal centers. * **Supporting Markers:** HLA-DQA1, CD79A, FERMT3, active metabolism/protein synthesis markers. 3. **Third Most Likely: Memory B cells:** * **Reasoning:** Memory B cells are long-lived, quiescent cells that can rapidly reactivate upon re-encountering antigen. While generally less metabolically active than activated B cells, they retain the capacity for antigen presentation (HLA-DQA1) and express CD79A. If these cells have recently been activated or are in a state of surveillance, their marker profile could fit. However, without specific memory B cell markers (e.g., CD27, specific Ig isotypes), it's less definitive than actively presenting B cells. * **Supporting Markers:** HLA-DQA1, CD79A, FERMT3. **Most Likely Subtype:** Based on the strong emphasis on **HLA-DQA1** (antigen presentation) and the general indicators of high metabolic and cytoskeletal activity (ARPC5L), the most likely subtype is **Activated B cells / Antigen-Presenting B cells**. These cells are actively engaged in immune responses within the large intestine. --- **Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis** The single-cell cluster from the human large intestine is identified as **Activated B Lymphocytes**. This annotation is primarily driven by the co-expression of the definitive B cell marker **CD79A**, the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule **HLA-DQA1** (indicating antigen-presenting capacity), and the hematopoietic-specific integrin activator **FERMT3 (Kindlin-3)**. The high ranking of HLA-DQA1 suggests an active role in antigen presentation, consistent with an activated B cell state. Furthermore, the presence of functional markers such as ARPC5L (actin remodeling), CCT7 (protein folding), and IDH2 (metabolism) supports a metabolically active cell with dynamic cytoskeletal processes, characteristic of B cells engaged in immune responses, migration, and antigen processing. The top three most probable subtypes are 1) Activated B cells / Antigen-Presenting B cells (most likely), 2) Germinal Center B cells, and 3) Memory B cells. The overall marker profile most strongly supports **Activated B cells / Antigen-Presenting B cells**.

CD14+ Monocytes,Myeloid Cell,"Inflammatory Monocytes/Macrophages, Neutrophils, Dendritic Cells (DCs)",,15,"S100A8, TMEM9B, GALK1, KARS, EIF1B, IRF8, ERH, MRPL40, GID8, POLR3K, NDUFA12, CWC15, NUMB, PDIA3, SAMD9L",1,google/gemini-2.5-flash,openrouter,large intestine,human,N/A,"Final Annotation Agent: Here's a step-by-step analysis to identify the cell type based on the provided marker list: **Step 1: List the Key Functional Markers** * **S100A8:** This gene encodes a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins. S100A8 (along with S100A9) forms a heterodimer called calprotectin, which is a major component of the cytosolic protein fraction of neutrophils and monocytes. It plays a crucial role in inflammation, immune response, and host defense, acting as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). Its presence is a strong indicator of myeloid cell activity, particularly neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes/macrophages. * **IRF8 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 8):** A transcription factor critical for the development and function of various immune cells, particularly myeloid cells. It is essential for the differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, and for the development of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). High expression often points towards cells of the myeloid lineage, especially those involved in antigen presentation or inflammatory responses. * **SAMD9L (Sterile Alpha Motif Domain Containing 9 Like):** While its exact function is still being elucidated, SAMD9L is known to be involved in innate immunity and has antiviral properties. It's often expressed in immune cells, particularly myeloid cells, and can be upregulated in response to viral infections or inflammatory stimuli. **Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers** * **S100A8:** As mentioned above, S100A8 is a canonical marker for neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes/macrophages. Its high expression is a strong indicator of these cell types. * **IRF8:** While not exclusively a cell type marker, IRF8 is a key lineage-determining transcription factor for myeloid cells, particularly monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Its presence supports a myeloid identity. * **TMEM9B (Transmembrane Protein 9B):** While broadly expressed, TMEM9B has been noted in some studies to be enriched in certain immune cell populations, including myeloid cells, though it's not a highly specific marker on its own. * **GALK1 (Galactokinase 1):** Involved in galactose metabolism. While generally considered a housekeeping gene, its differential expression can sometimes be observed in specific cell states or types, but it's not a primary cell type marker. * **KARS (Lysyl-tRNA Synthetase):** A tRNA ligase, essential for protein synthesis. Generally considered a housekeeping gene. * **EIF1B (Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 1B):** Involved in protein synthesis. Generally considered a housekeeping gene. * **ERH (Enhancer of Rudimentary Homolog):** Involved in cell cycle regulation and RNA processing. Generally considered a housekeeping gene. * **MRPL40 (Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L40):** A mitochondrial ribosomal protein. Generally considered a housekeeping gene. * **GID8 (Gid Complex Subunit 8):** Involved in ubiquitination and protein degradation. Generally considered a housekeeping gene. * **POLR3K (RNA Polymerase III Subunit K):** A subunit of RNA polymerase III. Generally considered a housekeeping gene. * **NDUFA12 (NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 12):** Involved in mitochondrial electron transport chain. Generally considered a housekeeping gene. * **CWC15 (Spliceosome-Associated Protein CWC15 Homolog):** Involved in mRNA splicing. Generally considered a housekeeping gene. * **NUMB (NUMB Endocytic Adaptor Protein):** Involved in endocytosis and Notch signaling. While broadly expressed, it can have specific roles in cell fate determination. Not a primary cell type marker in this context. * **PDIA3 (Protein Disulfide Isomerase Family A Member 3):** Involved in protein folding in the ER. Generally considered a housekeeping gene. **Summary of Key Markers:** The most prominent and specific cell type/functional markers in this list are **S100A8** and **IRF8**. The remaining genes appear to be largely housekeeping genes or genes with broader expression patterns, making S100A8 and IRF8 the primary drivers of the annotation. **Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases** * **S100A8:** Widely recognized as a marker for neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes, and certain macrophage subsets. In the context of the large intestine, these cells are abundant in the lamina propria during inflammation or homeostatic surveillance. * *Literature:* Numerous scRNA-seq studies of the large intestine and other tissues consistently identify S100A8/A9 as markers for myeloid cells, particularly inflammatory populations. * **IRF8:** Crucial for myeloid cell differentiation. High expression is found in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. * *Literature:* scRNA-seq atlases of immune cells and gut immunology studies confirm IRF8's role in myeloid lineage specification and function. * **SAMD9L:** While less specific than S100A8, SAMD9L expression is often observed in myeloid cells and is associated with innate immune responses. **Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type** The strong and high expression of **S100A8** and **IRF8** are highly indicative of cells belonging to the **myeloid lineage**. S100A8 is a classic marker for inflammatory myeloid cells, while IRF8 is a key transcription factor for monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The presence of SAMD9L further supports an immune, likely myeloid, identity. Therefore, the most probable general cell type is **Myeloid Cell**. **Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types** Given the markers, particularly S100A8 and IRF8, we can narrow down the myeloid lineage: 1. **Inflammatory Monocytes/Macrophages:** * **Reasoning:** S100A8 is a hallmark marker of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages, especially in the context of tissue inflammation (which is common in the large intestine). IRF8 is also crucial for monocyte and macrophage development and function. The high ranking of S100A8 suggests a strong inflammatory component. These cells are highly abundant in the gut lamina propria and play a critical role in immune surveillance and response to pathogens/commensals. 2. **Neutrophils:** * **Reasoning:** S100A8 (calprotectin) is also a very strong marker for neutrophils. Neutrophils are abundant in the large intestine, particularly during inflammation. While IRF8 is more associated with monocytes/macrophages/DCs, neutrophils do express some IRF family members, and their presence in the gut is significant. However, the absence of other canonical neutrophil markers (e.g., ELANE, MPO, G0S2) makes this less likely than inflammatory monocytes/macrophages, but still a strong possibility given S100A8. 3. **Dendritic Cells (DCs):** * **Reasoning:** IRF8 is a critical transcription factor for the development of various DC subsets, including conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). DCs are crucial antigen-presenting cells in the gut. However, S100A8 is generally not a primary marker for classical DCs, though some inflammatory DC subsets might express it. The prominence of S100A8 pushes this option lower than inflammatory monocytes/macrophages. **Most Likely Subtype:** Based on the strong expression of **S100A8** (indicating an inflammatory state and/or specific myeloid subsets) and the supportive role of **IRF8** (myeloid lineage specification), the most likely subtype is **Inflammatory Monocytes/Macrophages**. These cells are highly prevalent in the large intestine, especially in states of immune activation, and are characterized by high S100A8 expression. **Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis** The cell cluster is most likely composed of **Inflammatory Monocytes/Macrophages**. This annotation is primarily driven by the high expression of **S100A8**, a canonical marker for inflammatory myeloid cells, and **IRF8**, a key transcription factor for monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell development. While S100A8 is also a strong neutrophil marker, the combination with IRF8 and the typical immune landscape of the large intestine points more strongly towards monocytes/macrophages involved in inflammatory responses. The remaining genes are largely housekeeping genes, reinforcing the specificity of S100A8 and IRF8 as the primary annotating markers.

I will follow the prescribed steps to deduce the most probable cell type and its subtypes. **Marker List:** LTB, RPL7L1, DNAJC15, RPS19BP1, CDC37, RNASEH2B, ETHE1, RBCK1, GRSF1, TMCO1, C12orf10, FKBP3, RBBP6, SMAP2, PSMC4 --- ### Step 1: List the Key Functional Markers This list appears to be dominated by genes involved in fundamental cellular processes rather than highly specific functional pathways. * **Ribosomal Proteins & RNA Processing:** * **RPL7L1 (Ribosomal Protein L7-like 1):** A component of the large ribosomal subunit, crucial for protein synthesis. High expression often indicates active translation. * **RPS19BP1 (Ribosomal Protein S19 Binding Protein 1):** Involved in ribosome biogenesis and function, specifically interacting with ribosomal protein S19. * **GRSF1 (G-rich RNA sequence binding factor 1):** An RNA-binding protein involved in RNA processing, stability, and translation. * **RNASEH2B (Ribonuclease H2 Subunit B):** Part of an enzyme complex that removes RNA primers from Okazaki fragments during DNA replication and repair, and also involved in RNA processing. * **Chaperones & Protein Folding/Degradation:** * **DNAJC15 (DnaJ Heat Shock Protein Family (Hsp40) Member C15):** A co-chaperone that assists Hsp70 proteins in protein folding and quality control. * **CDC37 (Cell Division Cycle 37):** A co-chaperone that specifically binds to and stabilizes protein kinases, crucial for their maturation and activity. * **FKBP3 (FK506 Binding Protein 3):** A peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase and chaperone involved in protein folding and trafficking, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum. * **PSMC4 (Proteasome 26S Subunit, ATPase 4):** A component of the 26S proteasome, involved in ATP-dependent protein degradation. * **Metabolism & Cellular Homeostasis:** * **ETHE1 (Ethylmalonic Encephalopathy 1 Homolog):** Involved in sulfide detoxification, particularly in mitochondria. Essential for mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. * **Ubiquitination & Protein Regulation:** * **RBCK1 (RING-type E3 Ubiquitin Transferase):** An E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in targeting proteins for degradation, playing roles in various cellular processes including immune signaling. * **RBBP6 (Retinoblastoma Binding Protein 6):** Involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and ubiquitination. * **SMAP2 (Stromal Membrane Associated Protein 2):** Involved in endosomal trafficking and membrane dynamics, potentially linked to protein sorting. * **Other/Less Specific:** * **TMCO1 (Transmembrane and Coiled-Coil Domain Family 1):** A transmembrane protein with less clearly defined universal cellular function, but implicated in calcium homeostasis and ER stress. * **C12orf10 (Chromosome 12 Open Reading Frame 10):** A protein with largely uncharacterized function, often found in various cell types. **Summary of Functional Markers:** The majority of these genes are ""housekeeping"" genes involved in fundamental cellular processes such as protein synthesis (ribosomal proteins, RNA binding proteins), protein folding and quality control (chaperones, proteasome components), RNA processing, and basic metabolism. Their high expression suggests a metabolically active cell. --- ### Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers Upon initial inspection, one gene stands out as a potential cell-type specific marker, especially in the context of the large intestine: * **LTB (Lymphotoxin Beta):** This gene encodes a cytokine belonging to the TNF superfamily. It is primarily expressed by **lymphocytes**, particularly T cells, B cells, and NK cells, and plays a crucial role in lymphoid organ development and immune responses. Its presence is a strong indicator of an immune cell lineage. The remaining genes are largely ubiquitous or involved in general cellular functions, making them less specific for defining a particular cell type on their own. --- ### Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases Given the strong signal from **LTB**, I will focus my database search on immune cells within the large intestine. * **LTB:** A well-established marker for various lymphocyte populations. In the large intestine, lymphocytes are abundant, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). * **RPL7L1, DNAJC15, RPS19BP1, CDC37, RNASEH2B, ETHE1, RBCK1, GRSF1, TMCO1, C12orf10, FKBP3, RBBP6, SMAP2, PSMC4:** These genes are broadly expressed across many cell types, including immune cells, as they are involved in essential cellular maintenance. Their high expression in conjunction with LTB suggests a highly active immune cell. Searching scRNA-seq databases (e.g., Human Cell Atlas, PanglaoDB, specific large intestine atlases) for clusters expressing LTB as a top marker often points towards lymphoid populations. For instance, in many intestinal scRNA-seq datasets, LTB is found in clusters annotated as T cells, B cells, or ILCs. --- ### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type Based on the prominent expression of **LTB**, which is a definitive marker for lymphoid cells, and the presence of numerous housekeeping genes indicating active cellular machinery, the most probable general cell type is an **Immune Cell**, specifically a **Lymphocyte**. --- ### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types Now, let's refine the lymphocyte annotation. While LTB is a lymphocyte marker, it doesn't definitively distinguish between all lymphocyte subsets. However, its high ranking suggests a cell type where LTB is particularly active or highly expressed. 1. **Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILCs) / Lymphoid Tissue Inducer (LTi) cells:** * **Reasoning:** LTB is a key marker for ILCs, particularly ILC3s and LTi cells, which are abundant in the gut and crucial for lymphoid organ development and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. LTi cells are a subset of ILCs that express LTB and are critical for the formation of Peyer's patches and isolated lymphoid follicles in the intestine. The high expression of LTB, coupled with the general metabolic activity indicated by the housekeeping genes, is highly consistent with the role of ILCs in the dynamic intestinal environment. While ILCs also express other specific markers (e.g., RORC, IL7R, CD127), the strong LTB signal is a primary indicator. 2. **B Cells:** * **Reasoning:** B cells also express LTB, particularly activated B cells and those involved in lymphoid follicle formation. B cells are abundant in the large intestine, especially in Peyer's patches and isolated lymphoid follicles. The general metabolic activity would also be consistent with B cell function. However, without classic B cell markers like CD19, CD20 (MS4A1), or immunoglobulin genes (IGHM, IGKC), it's less definitive than ILCs where LTB is often a more defining feature in scRNA-seq analyses. 3. **T Cells (specifically a subset with high LTB expression):** * **Reasoning:** While T cells are a major lymphocyte population in the gut and can express LTB, it's typically not as universally high or defining a marker across all T cell subsets as it is for ILCs or certain B cell populations. Cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells have other more specific defining markers (e.g., CD3D/E/G, CD8A, CD4). However, certain activated T cell subsets or those involved in lymphoid structure formation could express LTB. **Most Likely Subtype:** Based on the strong and high ranking of LTB in a large intestine context, **Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILCs), particularly Lymphoid Tissue Inducer (LTi) cells or ILC3s**, are the most probable subtype. LTB is a central molecule for their function in lymphoid tissue organization and immune regulation in the gut. --- ### Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis The single-cell cluster from the human large intestine is characterized by the highly expressed marker **LTB (Lymphotoxin Beta)**, a key cytokine of the TNF superfamily primarily expressed by lymphocytes. The remaining highly expressed genes are largely ""housekeeping"" genes (e.g., RPL7L1, DNAJC15, RPS19BP1, CDC37, FKBP3, PSMC4) involved in fundamental cellular processes such as protein synthesis, folding, degradation, and general metabolism, indicating an actively functioning cell. Cross-referencing with known scRNA-seq databases and literature confirms LTB as a robust marker for lymphoid cells. Given its high ranking in the provided list, the general cell type is confidently identified as an **Immune Cell**, specifically a **Lymphocyte**. Further refinement points to **Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILCs)** as the most probable subtype, particularly **Lymphoid Tissue Inducer (LTi) cells or ILC3s**. LTB is a critical and highly expressed marker for these cells, which play vital roles in the development of intestinal lymphoid structures and immune homeostasis. While B cells and certain T cell subsets can also express LTB, the prominence of LTB in this marker list, without other definitive B or T cell lineage markers, strongly favors ILCs in the context of the large intestine. **FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED** | Coupling Validator: Validation result: VALIDATION PASSED | Formatting Agent: ```json { ""main_cell_type"": ""Immune Cell"", ""sub_cell_types"": [""Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILCs)"", ""B Cells"", ""T Cells""], ""possible_mixed_cell_types"": [] } ```"

Its presence alongside ARF6 suggests active regulation of membrane trafficking and cytoskeleton dynamics, which are critical for immune cell function. *Genes with more general cellular functions (e.g., UBE2D3, NUDT5, TCP1, CTNNBL1, MAPK1IP1L, POLR2I, ADSL, PRR5) are less specific for cell type identification without further context, but their high expression indicates active cellular processes.* ## Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers Based on the provided list, the most prominent cell type markers are the chemokines: * **CCL5:** A well-established marker for various activated immune cells, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), NK cells, and some subsets of macrophages and mast cells. * **CCL4:** Often co-expressed with CCL5, indicating an activated immune response. It's also found in activated T cells, NK cells, and monocytes/macrophages. The co-expression of these two chemokines at high levels is a strong indicator of an immune cell type, particularly those involved in inflammatory responses or cytotoxic functions. The other genes, while functionally relevant, are not as uniquely definitive for a specific immune cell type on their own but support the immune cell hypothesis. ## Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases and Literature Searching scRNA-seq databases (e.g., Human Cell Atlas, PanglaoDB, CellMarker) and literature for co-expression of CCL5 and CCL4 in the large intestine context reveals: * **Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and NK cells:** These are primary producers of CCL5 and CCL4, especially upon activation, playing crucial roles in immune surveillance and direct killing of target cells. * **Activated CD8+ T cells:** Known to upregulate CCL5 and CCL4 during effector phases. * **NKT cells:** Can also express these chemokines. * **Some subsets of macrophages/dendritic cells:** Can produce these chemokines, but often in response to specific stimuli and sometimes at lower levels compared to T/NK cells. * **Mast cells:** Can also produce these chemokines, particularly in allergic or inflammatory contexts. The presence of genes like ARF6, KIF5B, and ARPC4 further supports an immune cell identity, as these are critical for immune cell migration, phagocytosis, and granule release. ## Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type Based on the strong and high expression of **CCL5** and **CCL4**, which are potent chemokines primarily produced by immune cells, the most probable general cell type is an **Immune Cell**. The specific roles of these chemokines in recruiting other immune cells and mediating inflammatory responses strongly point towards an activated or effector immune cell population. ## Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types Given the high expression of CCL5 and CCL4, and considering the large intestine tissue context (which is rich in various immune populations), here are the top three most probable sub cell types: 1. **Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) / Activated CD8+ T cells:** * **Reasoning:** CTLs are well-known for producing high levels of CCL5 and CCL4 upon activation, which are crucial for recruiting other immune cells to sites of infection or inflammation. Genes like ARF6, KIF5B, and ARPC4 are essential for T cell activation, migration, and cytotoxic granule release. The large intestine is a common site for immune surveillance and inflammatory responses, where activated T cells are abundant. The high ranking of these chemokines suggests a highly active or effector state. 2. **Natural Killer (NK) Cells:** * **Reasoning:** NK cells also produce significant amounts of CCL5 and CCL4, especially when activated, contributing to antiviral and anti-tumor immunity. Their cytotoxic functions rely on similar cellular machinery (e.g., actin remodeling via ARPC4, granule transport via KIF5B). NK cells are present in the large intestine and play a role in mucosal immunity. 3. **NKT Cells (Natural Killer T cells):** * **Reasoning:** NKT cells share characteristics of both T cells and NK cells. They can rapidly produce large amounts of cytokines and chemokines, including CCL5 and CCL4, upon activation. They are found in various tissues, including the gut, and contribute to immune regulation and rapid responses. **Most Likely Subtype:** Based on the provided markers, the most likely subtype is **Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) / Activated CD8+ T cells**. The high expression of both CCL5 and CCL4, coupled with the general cellular machinery genes supporting active cell migration and effector functions, is highly characteristic of activated T cells in an inflammatory or immune surveillance context within the large intestine. While NK cells and NKT cells also express these markers, the overall profile, particularly the prominence of CCL5, often leans towards activated T cells in many scRNA-seq datasets of inflamed tissues. ## Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis The cell cluster exhibits high expression of the chemokines CCL5 and CCL4, which are potent chemoattractants and key mediators of immune responses. This strong chemokine signature, along with genes involved in membrane trafficking (ARF6, ACAP1), cytoskeleton remodeling (ARPC4), and intracellular transport (KIF5B), points definitively to an immune cell type. Cross-referencing with scRNA-seq databases and literature confirms that high co-expression of CCL5 and CCL4 is a hallmark of activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and NK cells. Considering the large intestine tissue context, the most probable general cell type is an **Immune Cell**. The top three most probable sub cell types are **Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) / Activated CD8+ T cells**, followed by **Natural Killer (NK) Cells**, and then **NKT Cells**. The most likely specific subtype is **Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) / Activated CD8+ T cells** due to the prominent and highly ranked expression of both CCL5 and CCL4, indicative of an active effector state.

Dendritic cells,Dendritic Cells,"Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDCs), Conventional Dendritic Cells (cDCs) - specifically cDC2 (CD1c+ DCs), Monocytes/Macrophages (Antigen-Presenting Subsets)",,15,"HLA-DQA1, MZT1, CLEC4C, RBM25, HSPB11, CAMK2G, FRAT1, KIAA0196, HAGH, DMAP1, NUDT5, GID8, CDV3, ORAI1, GLTP",1,google/gemini-2.5-flash,openrouter,large intestine,human,N/A,"Final Annotation Agent: Okay, I will meticulously analyze this list of highly expressed markers from a single-cell cluster derived from human large intestine tissue to identify the cell type. Here's my step-by-step analysis: ### Step 1: List the Key Functional Markers * **HLA-DQA1:** This gene encodes a subunit of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecule. MHC class II molecules are crucial for presenting antigens to CD4+ T lymphocytes, initiating immune responses. Their expression is characteristic of professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). * **CLEC4C (BDCA-2):** This gene encodes C-type lectin domain family 4 member C, also known as Blood Dendritic Cell Antigen 2 (BDCA-2). CLEC4C is a well-established and highly specific surface marker for plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). It functions as an inhibitory receptor that modulates type I interferon production. * **MZT1 (Meiotic Spindle T-cell Associated 1):** While its name suggests a role in meiosis, MZT1 has been implicated in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and immune regulation. Its specific functional role in immune cells is still being elucidated, but it's not a primary cell-type defining marker. * **HSPB11 (Heat Shock Protein Family B (Small) Member 11):** A small heat shock protein, typically involved in protein folding, stress response, and apoptosis. Its expression can be induced by various cellular stresses and is not specific to a particular immune cell type. * **CAMK2G (Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase II Gamma):** A serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in various signaling pathways, including those related to calcium signaling, neuronal plasticity, and immune cell activation. Its presence is not highly specific for a particular immune cell type. * **FRAT1 (Factor Regulating ApopTosis 1):** Involved in Wnt signaling and can regulate apoptosis. Not a primary immune cell marker. * **KIAA0196, HAGH, DMAP1, NUDT5, GID8, CDV3, ORAI1, GLTP:** These genes generally encode proteins involved in basic cellular processes such as metabolism (HAGH, NUDT5), DNA repair (DMAP1), cell cycle regulation (GID8, CDV3), calcium signaling (ORAI1), and lipid transport (GLTP). While essential for cell function, they are not typically used as specific markers for immune cell identification. ORAI1, encoding a calcium channel, is important for immune cell activation but not specific to a single cell type. **Summary of Key Functional Markers:** The most prominent functional markers here are **HLA-DQA1** (MHC class II, indicating antigen presentation) and **CLEC4C** (a highly specific marker for pDCs). The other genes are more general cellular machinery or less specific immune regulators. ### Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers * **HLA-DQA1:** As discussed, a key marker for professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which include dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. * **CLEC4C (BDCA-2):** This is the most definitive cell type marker in the list. It is a canonical and highly specific surface marker for **plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs)**. Its high expression is a strong indicator of this cell type. **Summary of Key Cell Type Markers:** The presence of **CLEC4C** is overwhelmingly indicative of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The co-expression of **HLA-DQA1** is consistent with pDCs, as they are professional APCs. ### Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases Cross-referencing these markers with scRNA-seq databases (e.g., Human Cell Atlas, PanglaoDB, CellMarker) and literature confirms the following: * **CLEC4C (BDCA-2):** Consistently listed as a top marker for plasmacytoid dendritic cells across various human tissues, including the intestine. * **HLA-DQA1:** Frequently found in dendritic cells (including pDCs), macrophages, and B cells. Its co-expression with CLEC4C strongly supports a pDC identity. * Other markers like MZT1, HSPB11, CAMK2G, etc., are not typically used as primary identifiers for specific immune cell types but can be expressed in various cell types, including immune cells, depending on their activation state or specific functions. The high expression of these more general genes alongside highly specific markers suggests a metabolically active cell type. ### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type Based on the strong and specific expression of **CLEC4C** and the supportive expression of **HLA-DQA1**, the most probable general cell type is **Dendritic Cells**. ### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types 1. **Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDCs):** * **Reasoning:** The presence of **CLEC4C** (BDCA-2) as a highly expressed marker is the definitive evidence for pDCs. CLEC4C is considered a gold standard marker for this cell type. pDCs are known for their high expression of MHC class II molecules (like HLA-DQA1) and their primary role in producing large amounts of type I interferons in response to viral infections. They are present in various tissues, including the large intestine. The other markers, while not specific, do not contradict a pDC identity. 2. **Conventional Dendritic Cells (cDCs) - specifically cDC2 (CD1c+ DCs):** * **Reasoning:** While CLEC4C is specific to pDCs, cDCs also express high levels of MHC class II (HLA-DQA1) and are professional APCs. However, the absence of typical cDC markers (e.g., CD1C, FCER1A, CD1A for cDC2; XCR1, CLEC9A, CADM1 for cDC1) and the strong presence of CLEC4C makes cDCs a less likely primary annotation than pDCs. If CLEC4C expression was lower or absent, and other cDC markers were present, this would be a stronger contender. 3. **Monocytes/Macrophages (Antigen-Presenting Subsets):** * **Reasoning:** Certain subsets of monocytes and macrophages, particularly those activated or tissue-resident, can express high levels of MHC class II (HLA-DQA1) and function as APCs. However, they typically lack CLEC4C expression. The presence of CLEC4C strongly argues against a primary monocyte/macrophage identity. **Most Likely Subtype:** Based on the overwhelming evidence from **CLEC4C**, the most likely subtype is **Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDCs)**. ### Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis The single-cell cluster from human large intestine tissue is most confidently identified as **Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDCs)**. This annotation is primarily driven by the high expression of **CLEC4C (BDCA-2)**, a highly specific and canonical marker for pDCs. The co-expression of **HLA-DQA1**, encoding an MHC class II molecule, further supports this identification, as pDCs are professional antigen-presenting cells. While other markers in the list are more general cellular components, their presence does not contradict a pDC identity. The overall marker profile strongly points to a cell type specialized in immune surveillance and type I interferon production.

FCGR3A+ Monocytes,Immune Cell,"Natural Killer (NK) Cells, Non-classical (Patrolling) Monocytes / Macrophages, Interferon-Stimulated Myeloid Cells",,15,"FCGR3A, MRPS23, BLCAP, MRPL43, DIAPH1, COPS4, ALDH2, RP11-139H15.1, CSRP1, IFIT2, PARL, PSMD14, FKBP3, DNTTIP1, SIK1",1,google/gemini-2.5-flash,openrouter,large intestine,human,N/A,"Final Annotation Agent: Okay, I will meticulously analyze the provided list of highly expressed markers from a single-cell cluster in human large intestine tissue to determine its cell type. Here's my step-by-step analysis: ### Step 1: List the Key Functional Markers This step focuses on genes that indicate cellular processes, pathways, or general cellular states rather than specific cell identities. * **MRPS23, MRPL43, PSMD14:** These genes are involved in ribosomal function (mitochondrial ribosomal proteins) and proteasome activity (proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 14). High expression often indicates active protein synthesis and degradation, characteristic of metabolically active cells. * **COPS4:** Component of the COP9 signalosome complex, involved in ubiquitination and protein degradation, and thus cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. * **DIAPH1:** Diaphanous related formin 1, involved in actin polymerization and cytoskeletal organization. This suggests active cellular motility, shape changes, or structural maintenance. * **ALDH2:** Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, involved in detoxification of aldehydes. This can be highly expressed in cells with high metabolic activity or those exposed to environmental toxins, such as cells in the gut. * **IFIT2:** Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2. This gene is strongly induced by interferons and plays a role in antiviral defense and immune responses. Its presence suggests an activated immune state or response to a pathogen/inflammatory signal. * **FKBP3:** FK506 binding protein 3, a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase. Involved in protein folding and chaperone activity. * **SIK1:** Salt-inducible kinase 1, involved in various cellular processes including metabolism and inflammation. * **PARL:** Presenilin associated rhomboid like, a mitochondrial protease involved in mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis. * **DNTTIP1:** Deoxynucleotidyltransferase, terminal, interacting protein 1. Involved in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling. * **RP11-139H15.1:** This is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). While lncRNAs can have diverse regulatory functions, without specific functional annotation tied to this particular lncRNA, it's difficult to assign a general functional role solely based on its name. Its presence might be indicative of specific cellular states or regulatory networks, but its direct functional interpretation is limited here. * **BLCAP:** Bladder cancer associated protein. While its name suggests a link to cancer, its normal physiological function is less well-defined but has been implicated in cell growth and apoptosis. * **CSRP1:** Cysteine rich protein 1. Involved in cell differentiation and cytoskeletal organization. **Summary of Functional Markers:** The presence of ribosomal and proteasomal components (MRPS23, MRPL43, PSMD14, COPS4) suggests high metabolic activity. Cytoskeletal elements (DIAPH1, CSRP1) point to dynamic cellular processes. The most striking functional marker is **IFIT2**, which strongly indicates an immune response or an activated state, likely in response to viral infection or inflammation. ALDH2 suggests detoxification capabilities. ### Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers This step focuses on genes known to be specific to certain cell lineages or types. * **FCGR3A (CD16a):** This is the absolute standout marker in this list. FCGR3A encodes for the Fc gamma receptor IIIa, a low-affinity immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc region receptor. It is a well-established and highly specific marker for **Natural Killer (NK) cells** and a subset of **macrophages/monocytes** (specifically non-classical monocytes, also known as patrolling monocytes, and some tissue-resident macrophages). In the context of the large intestine, its presence is highly suggestive of immune cells. **Summary of Cell Type Markers:** The overwhelming evidence points to **FCGR3A** as the primary cell type-specific marker. Its high expression immediately narrows down the possibilities to NK cells or specific monocyte/macrophage subsets. ### Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases I will cross-reference these markers, particularly FCGR3A and IFIT2, with known single-cell RNA sequencing databases and literature pertaining to human large intestine. * **FCGR3A (CD16a):** In the large intestine, FCGR3A+ cells are predominantly NK cells and a subset of monocytes/macrophages. NK cells are crucial for immune surveillance and anti-viral/anti-tumor responses. Monocytes/macrophages are antigen-presenting cells and phagocytes, also involved in immune responses. * **IFIT2:** As mentioned, IFIT2 is an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). Its co-expression with FCGR3A is significant. NK cells are known to be highly responsive to interferons, and interferon signaling is critical for their activation and effector functions. Monocytes/macrophages also express ISGs upon interferon stimulation. * **CSRP1:** While not a primary immune marker, CSRP1 has been observed in some immune cell types, including macrophages, and can be involved in their differentiation and function. * **DIAPH1:** Involved in phagocytosis and cell migration, processes common to both NK cells and macrophages. The co-expression of a strong immune cell marker (FCGR3A) with an interferon-stimulated gene (IFIT2) is a critical piece of information. ### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type Based on the strong expression of **FCGR3A** and the presence of **IFIT2** (an interferon-stimulated gene), the most probable general cell type is an **Immune Cell**. More specifically, it points towards **lymphoid or myeloid cells** involved in innate immunity. ### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types Now, let's refine this based on the full marker list, considering the context of the large intestine. 1. **Natural Killer (NK) Cells:** * **FCGR3A (CD16a):** This is a canonical marker for NK cells. * **IFIT2:** NK cells are highly responsive to interferons, and IFIT2 expression is consistent with activated NK cells, potentially in response to viral infection or inflammation, which are common in the gut. * **DIAPH1, CSRP1:** These genes are involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration, essential for NK cell surveillance and cytotoxicity. * **Metabolic genes (MRPS23, MRPL43, PSMD14):** Activated NK cells are metabolically active. * **ALDH2:** While not a primary NK cell marker, ALDH2 has been implicated in immune cell metabolism and function, including in NK cells. * **Overall:** The combination of FCGR3A and IFIT2 strongly supports NK cells, especially activated or interferon-stimulated NK cells. 2. **Non-classical (Patrolling) Monocytes / Macrophages:** * **FCGR3A (CD16a):** Non-classical monocytes (CD14- CD16+) are characterized by high FCGR3A expression. Some tissue-resident macrophages can also express FCGR3A. * **IFIT2:** Monocytes and macrophages are also highly responsive to interferons and can express ISGs like IFIT2, particularly during inflammatory states or viral infections. * **DIAPH1, CSRP1:** These genes are crucial for monocyte/macrophage migration, phagocytosis, and tissue remodeling. * **Metabolic genes:** Macrophages are highly metabolically active, especially when activated. * **ALDH2:** Macrophages are known to express ALDH2, particularly in inflammatory contexts, where it can play a role in oxidative stress response. * **Overall:** This is a strong contender due to FCGR3A and IFIT2, and the functional markers align well with monocyte/macrophage functions. Distinguishing between NK cells and non-classical monocytes solely based on this list can be challenging without additional canonical markers (e.g., CD3, CD56 for NK; CD14, CD68 for monocytes/macrophages). However, the high ranking of FCGR3A is very indicative of these two specific cell types. 3. **Interferon-Stimulated Myeloid Cells (e.g., Dendritic Cells or other Macrophage subsets):** * **IFIT2:** The strong presence of IFIT2 indicates an interferon-stimulated state, which can affect various myeloid cells. * **FCGR3A:** While not all dendritic cells or macrophage subsets express FCGR3A at high levels, some populations might, especially in inflammatory environments. For example, some inflammatory DCs or specific macrophage subsets could upregulate FCGR3A. * **Functional markers:** The general metabolic and cytoskeletal markers are consistent with activated myeloid cells. * **Overall:** This is a broader category, acknowledging the interferon response. However, without more specific markers for DCs (e.g., CD1c, CD141) or other macrophage subsets (e.g., CD68, CD206), it's less specific than the top two. The high FCGR3A pushes it more towards NK cells or non-classical monocytes. **Most Likely Subtype:** Given the very high expression of **FCGR3A** and the co-expression of **IFIT2**, the most likely subtype is **Natural Killer (NK) Cells**, specifically **activated or interferon-stimulated NK cells**. While non-classical monocytes are a strong possibility due to FCGR3A, the overall profile, particularly the prominence of IFIT2, often aligns very well with NK cell activation in response to interferons in the context of immune surveillance in tissues like the large intestine. Many of the other functional markers (metabolic activity, cytoskeletal dynamics) are consistent with highly active immune effector cells like NK cells. ### Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis The single-cell cluster from human large intestine tissue is most likely composed of **Natural Killer (NK) Cells**, specifically those that are **activated or interferon-stimulated**. The primary evidence for this annotation is the very high expression of **FCGR3A (CD16a)**, a canonical marker for NK cells. This is strongly supported by the co-expression of **IFIT2**, an interferon-stimulated gene, indicating an active immune response or exposure to interferons, which are crucial for NK cell activation and effector functions. Other highly expressed genes, including ribosomal proteins (MRPS23, MRPL43), proteasomal components (PSMD14, COPS4), and cytoskeletal regulators (DIAPH1, CSRP1), reflect the high metabolic activity and dynamic nature characteristic of activated immune effector cells like NK cells. While non-classical monocytes also express FCGR3A, the overall marker profile, particularly the strong interferon signature, points more specifically towards activated NK cells in this context.

My goal is to identify the most probable cell type and its subtypes, leveraging my expertise in scRNA-seq and relevant biological knowledge. Here's my step-by-step analysis: **Marker List:** PPBP, TMEM40, SH3GLB1, SRM, MRPL51, GP1BA, OAS1, RILPL2, SNX3, FNTA, TMEM208, KIF5B, RPL22L1, PFDN2, CARHSP1 --- **1. List the Key Functional Markers:** * **PPBP (Pro-Platelet Basic Protein / CXCL7):** This is a chemokine and a precursor to several smaller proteins, including NAP-2 (Neutrophil-activating peptide 2). It's primarily associated with platelets, megakaryocytes, and inflammation. It plays a role in platelet aggregation and neutrophil activation. * **GP1BA (Glycoprotein Ib (platelet), alpha polypeptide):** This gene encodes the alpha chain of glycoprotein Ib (GPIb), a critical component of the GPIb-IX-V receptor complex on the surface of platelets. This complex is essential for platelet adhesion to the subendothelium at sites of vascular injury, primarily by binding to von Willebrand factor (vWF). Its presence is a very strong indicator of platelet or megakaryocyte lineage. * **OAS1 (2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1):** An interferon-induced antiviral enzyme. While not specific to a single cell type, its upregulation often indicates an antiviral response or immune activation. * **SRM (Spermidine Synthase):** Involved in polyamine biosynthesis, essential for cell growth and proliferation. While ubiquitously expressed, its relative abundance can vary. * **KIF5B (Kinesin Family Member 5B):** A motor protein involved in intracellular transport along microtubules. Ubiquitously expressed, but its presence highlights active cellular transport processes. * **RPL22L1 (Ribosomal Protein L22 Like 1):** A ribosomal protein. High expression often indicates active protein synthesis, common in many cell types. * **PFDN2 (Prefoldin Subunit 2):** A component of the prefoldin complex, which acts as a molecular chaperone, assisting in the folding of newly synthesized proteins. Ubiquitously expressed. * **CARHSP1 (Calcium Regulated Heat Stable Protein 1):** Involved in mRNA stability and translation. Its expression can be modulated by various cellular stresses. **Functional Marker Summary:** The most striking functional markers here are **PPBP** and **GP1BA**, which are overwhelmingly associated with platelet function and megakaryocyte lineage. Other markers like OAS1 suggest potential immune or stress responses, while SRM, KIF5B, RPL22L1, and PFDN2 are more general indicators of active cellular metabolism and protein synthesis. --- **2. List the Key Cell Type Markers:** * **PPBP:** Strongly associated with platelets and megakaryocytes. * **GP1BA:** A definitive marker for platelets and megakaryocytes. It's a core component of the platelet surface receptor complex. * **TMEM40, SH3GLB1, MRPL51, RILPL2, SNX3, FNTA, TMEM208:** These genes are generally more ubiquitously expressed or have less specific cell type associations in the context of highly specific markers like GP1BA. They might be involved in various cellular processes (e.g., membrane trafficking, mitochondrial function, protein prenylation) but do not point to a unique cell identity on their own. For example, MRPL51 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, and SNX3 is involved in endosomal trafficking. **Cell Type Marker Summary:** The presence of **PPBP** and, most critically, **GP1BA** as highly expressed markers is a very strong indicator of a cell type related to the megakaryocyte-platelet lineage. These are not typically found at high levels in other large intestine cell types (e.g., epithelial cells, fibroblasts, immune cells other than potentially infiltrating platelets). --- **3. Cross-reference Known Databases:** A quick search in scRNA-seq databases (e.g., Human Protein Atlas, CellMarker, PanglaoDB, literature searches on specific markers) confirms the strong association of PPBP and GP1BA with: * **Platelets:** Both are canonical markers. * **Megakaryocytes:** Precursors to platelets, also express these genes. For example: * **GP1BA:** Listed as a top marker for platelets and megakaryocytes across numerous datasets. * **PPBP:** Also consistently found in platelets and megakaryocytes. The other markers are more broadly expressed, but their co-expression with GP1BA and PPBP in a high-ranking fashion strongly biases the interpretation towards the megakaryocyte-platelet lineage. The context of ""large intestine tissue"" is important here. While megakaryocytes are primarily in the bone marrow, platelets circulate throughout the body and can be found in any tissue, often as contaminants or due to local microvascular events. --- **4. Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type:** Based on the overwhelming evidence from **GP1BA** and **PPBP**, the most probable general cell type is **Platelets** or cells of the **Megakaryocyte-Platelet lineage**. Given that this is from large intestine tissue, the presence of circulating platelets within the tissue vasculature or as contaminants during tissue processing is highly likely. While megakaryocytes are bone marrow residents, their presence in peripheral tissues is rare but not impossible (e.g., extramedullary hematopoiesis, though highly unlikely to be the dominant signal in a large intestine biopsy). Therefore, platelets are the most direct and probable interpretation. --- **5. Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types:** Considering the general cell type is Platelets/Megakaryocyte-Platelet lineage, let's refine the subtypes: 1. **Platelets (Most Likely):** * **Reasoning:** The high expression of both **GP1BA** and **PPBP** is the hallmark of mature platelets. Platelets are anucleated cell fragments derived from megakaryocytes and are abundant in the bloodstream. They are frequently observed in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of various tissues, often as a ""contaminant"" from blood within the tissue vasculature or during sample dissociation. Their presence in large intestine tissue is expected due to the rich vascularization. The other markers (e.g., ribosomal proteins, chaperones, transport proteins) are consistent with the residual machinery found in platelets, which, despite being anucleated, still contain mRNA and ribosomes for limited protein synthesis. 2. **Megakaryocytes (Less Likely, but possible):** * **Reasoning:** Megakaryocytes are the direct precursors to platelets and express both **GP1BA** and **PPBP**. However, megakaryocytes are primarily found in the bone marrow. Their presence in the large intestine would be highly unusual unless there's an underlying pathological condition like extramedullary hematopoiesis, which is not indicated by the provided data. If this were a bone marrow sample, megakaryocytes would be a top candidate. In a large intestine sample, it's less probable than circulating platelets. 3. **Immature Megakaryocytes / Megakaryocyte Progenitors (Least Likely):** * **Reasoning:** While these cells also belong to the lineage and would express some of these markers, their expression profile might be slightly different, potentially including more progenitor-specific markers or lower levels of highly mature platelet markers. Given the strong expression of definitive mature platelet markers like GP1BA, mature platelets are a more direct fit. **Most Likely Subtype:** **Platelets** --- **6. Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis:** The single-cell cluster from human large intestine tissue is most confidently identified as **Platelets**. This annotation is primarily driven by the very high expression of canonical platelet markers, specifically **GP1BA** (Glycoprotein Ib alpha chain) and **PPBP** (Pro-Platelet Basic Protein/CXCL7). GP1BA is a critical component of the platelet surface receptor complex essential for adhesion, while PPBP is a chemokine stored in platelet alpha-granules. The co-expression of these two markers at high levels is a definitive signature of platelets. While other markers in the list are more broadly expressed (e.g., ribosomal proteins, chaperones, transport proteins), their presence is consistent with the residual cellular machinery found in anucleated platelets. Given the tissue origin (large intestine), the presence of circulating platelets within the tissue vasculature or as a common dissociation artifact is highly probable. Megakaryocytes, the precursors to platelets, are a less likely alternative due to their primary residence in the bone marrow, making their significant presence in the large intestine unusual without specific pathology. **FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED** | Coupling Validator: Validation result: VALIDATION PASSED | Formatting Agent: ```json { ""main_cell_type"": ""Platelets"", ""sub_cell_types"": [ ""Platelets"", ""Megakaryocytes"", ""Immature Megakaryocytes / Megakaryocyte Progenitors"" ], ""possible_mixed_cell_types"": [] } ```"

I will follow the requested step-by-step process, providing a comprehensive and specific analysis for an expert audience. **Marker List:** NKG7, ERH, NME3, VAPA, RMDN3, NKTR, PSMA7, CHMP4A, ARL2BP, UQCRC1, PCMT1, BTN3A2, MRPL41, SRP72, TGOLN2 --- ### Step 1: List the Key Functional Markers This step focuses on genes that broadly indicate cellular processes or pathways, rather than specific cell identities. * **NME3 (NME/NM23 Family Member 3):** A nucleoside diphosphate kinase, involved in nucleotide metabolism and maintaining cellular ATP/GTP ratios. Also implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis. Its high expression suggests active cellular metabolism. * **VAPA (VAMP-associated protein A):** An integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, involved in lipid transport, membrane contact sites, and vesicle trafficking. High expression often points to active membrane dynamics and cellular transport. * **PSMA7 (Proteasome 20S Subunit Alpha 7):** A core component of the 20S proteasome, responsible for protein degradation. High expression indicates active protein turnover, a characteristic of metabolically active cells. * **UQCRC1 (Ubiquinol-Cytochrome C Reductase Core Protein 1):** A core component of mitochondrial complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex), essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. High expression points to high metabolic activity and reliance on aerobic respiration. * **MRPL41 (Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L41):** A component of the large ribosomal subunit in mitochondria, essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. High expression further supports active mitochondrial function and high metabolic demand. * **TGOLN2 (Trans-Golgi Network Integral Membrane Protein 2):** A protein localized to the trans-Golgi network, involved in protein sorting and transport. Indicates active secretory pathway and membrane trafficking. * **CHMP4A (Charged Multivesicular Body Protein 4A):** A component of the ESCRT-III complex, involved in membrane budding and scission events, including multivesicular body formation, cytokinesis, and viral budding. Suggests active membrane remodeling and trafficking. * **ARL2BP (ADP-Ribosylation Factor Like 2 Binding Protein):** Involved in regulating microtubule dynamics and cellular transport. * **RMDN3 (Remodelin 3):** Involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and cell morphology. * **SRP72 (Signal Recognition Particle 72):** A component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex, which mediates co-translational protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum. Indicates active protein synthesis and secretion. * **PCMT1 (Protein-L-Isoaspartate (D-Aspartate) O-Methyltransferase):** Involved in protein repair by converting L-isoaspartyl residues to L-aspartyl residues. Suggests active protein maintenance and turnover. **Summary of Functional Markers:** Many of these genes (NME3, VAPA, PSMA7, UQCRC1, MRPL41, TGOLN2, CHMP4A, SRP72, PCMT1) point towards a cell with high metabolic activity, active protein synthesis and degradation, robust membrane trafficking, and significant mitochondrial function. This is a general characteristic of many active cell types, but particularly relevant for immune cells that are constantly responding and remodeling. --- ### Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers This step focuses on genes that are highly specific to particular cell lineages or types. * **NKG7 (Natural Killer Cell Granule Protein 7):** This is the most striking and specific marker in the list. NKG7 is a transmembrane protein primarily expressed in cytotoxic lymphocytes, including Natural Killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). It is associated with the lytic granules and plays a role in granule exocytosis and cytotoxicity. Its high expression is a strong indicator of a cytotoxic immune cell. * **BTN3A2 (Butyrophilin Subfamily 3 Member A2):** Butyrophilins are a family of transmembrane glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. BTN3A2 is expressed on various immune cells, including T cells, NK cells, and monocytes. While not as specific as NKG7, its presence in conjunction with NKG7 further supports an immune cell identity, particularly within the lymphocyte lineage. It has been implicated in immune regulation and antigen presentation. **Summary of Cell Type Markers:** The presence of **NKG7** is overwhelmingly indicative of a cytotoxic lymphocyte. **BTN3A2** provides additional support for an immune cell, specifically a lymphocyte. --- ### Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases Given the strong signal from NKG7, I will focus my cross-referencing on immune cell types, particularly cytotoxic lymphocytes, in the context of the large intestine. * **NKG7:** A canonical marker for NK cells and cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells). It is consistently found in scRNA-seq datasets to delineate these populations. * *Literature:* Studies on immune cell populations in the large intestine frequently identify NKG7+ cells as either NK cells or CD8+ T cells. For example, single-cell atlases of the human gut immune system (e.g., from the Human Cell Atlas, specific gut immunology studies) consistently show NKG7 expression in these cytotoxic populations. * **BTN3A2:** While broadly expressed on immune cells, its co-expression with NKG7 is common in cytotoxic lymphocytes. * **Other markers (e.g., NME3, VAPA, PSMA7, UQCRC1):** These are generally expressed in metabolically active cells and are not specific enough to differentiate between NK cells and cytotoxic T cells on their own. However, their high expression is consistent with the active state of cytotoxic lymphocytes. **Database Search Strategy:** 1. **GeneCards/UniProt:** Confirm primary expression patterns and functions of NKG7 and BTN3A2. 2. **Human Protein Atlas (HPA):** Check tissue and cell type specificity for protein expression. HPA confirms strong expression of NKG7 in lymphoid tissues and immune cells. 3. **Single Cell Expression Atlases (e.g., Azimuth, CellMarker, PanglaoDB, Tabula Sapiens):** Query ""NKG7"" in human large intestine datasets. This consistently points to NK cells and CD8+ T cells as the primary expressors. Searching for ""NKG7"" and ""BTN3A2"" co-expression further refines this to cytotoxic lymphocytes. **Conclusion from Cross-referencing:** The marker profile, especially NKG7, strongly points towards a cytotoxic lymphocyte population. --- ### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type Based on the overwhelming evidence from the key cell type marker **NKG7**, supported by the general immune cell marker BTN3A2 and the functional markers indicating high metabolic activity, the most probable general cell type is a **Cytotoxic Lymphocyte**. --- ### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types Now, I will differentiate between the cytotoxic lymphocyte subtypes. 1. **Natural Killer (NK) Cells:** * **Reasoning:** NKG7 is a hallmark marker of NK cells. NK cells are abundant in the large intestine, particularly in the lamina propria and intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) compartments, where they play crucial roles in immune surveillance against infected or transformed cells. The high metabolic activity indicated by the functional markers is consistent with the active effector functions of NK cells. While canonical NK cell markers like *CD3E* (absent), *CD56/NCAM1* (not listed), *FCGR3A/CD16* (not listed), or *KLRD1/CD94* (not listed) are not explicitly present, *NKG7* alone is a very strong indicator. The absence of T-cell specific markers (e.g., *CD3D, CD3E, CD4, CD8A, CD8B*) makes NK cells a highly probable candidate. * *Consideration:* In the absence of other specific NK cell markers, the annotation relies heavily on NKG7. However, NKG7 is often one of the most highly expressed genes in NK cells. 2. **CD8+ Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs):** * **Reasoning:** NKG7 is also highly expressed in activated CD8+ CTLs, which are critical for clearing intracellular pathogens and tumor cells. CTLs are also abundant in the large intestine, particularly as IELs. Like NK cells, CTLs are metabolically active and utilize similar cytotoxic mechanisms (e.g., granule exocytosis). The absence of *CD3D/E* (pan T cell marker) and *CD8A/B* (CD8+ T cell marker) in the provided list makes this less likely than NK cells if this list represents *all* highly expressed markers. However, if these markers were *not* among the *top 15* but still expressed, it could be a CTL. Given only the provided list, NK cells are slightly more probable due to the lack of T-cell specific markers. * *Consideration:* If this cluster were CD8+ T cells, one would typically expect to see *CD3E* or *CD8A/B* among the top markers, especially if they are highly expressed. Their absence here is a significant point against CTLs being the *most* likely candidate. 3. **NKT Cells (Natural Killer T Cells):** * **Reasoning:** NKT cells share characteristics of both T cells and NK cells, expressing T-cell receptors (like CD3) and NK cell markers (like NKG7). They are present in the large intestine. However, they are generally less abundant than conventional NK cells or CD8+ T cells. The absence of *CD3E* or other T-cell receptor components in the top markers makes this less likely than conventional NK cells or CD8+ T cells. * *Consideration:* NKT cells are a hybrid population. Without explicit T-cell markers, it's difficult to definitively identify them solely based on NKG7. **Most Likely Subtype:** Based on the provided marker list, particularly the strong presence of **NKG7** and the *absence* of canonical T-cell markers (like CD3E, CD8A, CD8B) among the top highly expressed genes, the most likely subtype is **Natural Killer (NK) Cells**. While CD8+ T cells also express NKG7, the lack of T-cell specific markers in a ""highly expressed"" list makes them a less probable primary annotation compared to NK cells. --- ### Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis The single-cell cluster from the human large intestine exhibits a highly distinctive gene expression profile. The most prominent marker, **NKG7**, is a canonical indicator of cytotoxic lymphocytes, specifically Natural Killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The presence of BTN3A2 further supports an immune cell identity. The remaining highly expressed genes (e.g., NME3, VAPA, PSMA7, UQCRC1, MRPL41, TGOLN2) are associated with high metabolic activity, active protein synthesis and degradation, and robust membrane trafficking, all consistent with the effector functions of cytotoxic immune cells. Cross-referencing with scRNA-seq databases and literature confirms that NKG7 is a primary marker for NK cells and CD8+ T cells in the large intestine. Given the strong expression of NKG7 and the *absence* of canonical T-cell specific markers (e.g., CD3D/E, CD8A/B) among the top 15 highly expressed genes, **Natural Killer (NK) Cells** are the most probable general and specific cell type for this cluster. While CD8+ T cells are also cytotoxic and express NKG7, their defining T-cell receptor and co-receptor markers are not present in this top list, making NK cells a more parsimonious explanation for the observed profile. **FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED** | Coupling Validator: Validation result: VALIDATION PASSED | Formatting Agent: ```json { ""main_cell_type"": ""Cytotoxic Lymphocyte"", ""sub_cell_types"": [""Natural Killer (NK) Cells"", ""CD8+ Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs)"", ""NKT Cells (Natural Killer T Cells)""], ""possible_mixed_cell_types"": [] } ```"
