Collecting duct cells,Principal Cells of the Collecting Duct,,,4,1,"Final Annotation Agent: To annotate the cell type based on the provided ranked marker list, let's go through the steps systematically:

### Step 1: List the Key Functional Markers
- **Gata3**: This is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development and function of various tissues, including the kidney. It is involved in the regulation of epithelial cell differentiation and is known to be expressed in certain types of epithelial cells.
- **Krt7 (Keratin 7)**: This is an intermediate filament protein typically expressed in epithelial cells. It is often used as a marker for certain types of epithelial cells, particularly those in glandular tissues and ducts.
- **Scnn1b (Sodium Channel Epithelial 1 Beta Subunit)** and **Scnn1g (Sodium Channel Epithelial 1 Gamma Subunit)**: These are subunits of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is crucial for sodium balance and fluid homeostasis in epithelial tissues, including the kidney.

### Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers
- **Gata3**: In the context of the kidney, Gata3 is often associated with collecting duct cells, particularly principal cells.
- **Krt7**: This marker is commonly found in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct cells of the kidney.
- **Scnn1b and Scnn1g**: These markers are indicative of principal cells in the collecting duct, where they play a role in sodium reabsorption.

### Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases
Using scRNA-seq databases such as the Human Cell Atlas or the Kidney Interactive Transcriptomics (KIT) database, we can cross-reference these markers:
- **Gata3** and **Krt7** are frequently associated with epithelial cells in the kidney, particularly in the collecting duct.
- **Scnn1b** and **Scnn1g** are strongly indicative of principal cells in the collecting duct, as they are involved in sodium transport.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type
Based on the expression of these markers, the most likely general cell type is **epithelial cells of the kidney**, specifically those involved in the distal nephron segments.

### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types
1. **Principal Cells of the Collecting Duct**: These cells express Gata3, Krt7, Scnn1b, and Scnn1g, which are all markers associated with sodium reabsorption and fluid balance.
2. **Intercalated Cells of the Collecting Duct**: While not as strongly indicated by these markers, intercalated cells are another cell type in the collecting duct, but they typically do not express Scnn1b and Scnn1g.
3. **Distal Convoluted Tubule Cells**: These cells can express Krt7, but the presence of Scnn1b and Scnn1g makes this less likely compared to principal cells.

The most likely subtype based on the markers is **Principal Cells of the Collecting Duct**.

### Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis
The expression profile of Gata3, Krt7, Scnn1b, and Scnn1g strongly suggests that the cell cluster represents **Principal Cells of the Collecting Duct** in the kidney. These cells are responsible for sodium reabsorption and play a critical role in maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance.
