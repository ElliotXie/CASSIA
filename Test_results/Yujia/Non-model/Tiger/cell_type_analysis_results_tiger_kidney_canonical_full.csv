Endothelial cells,endothelial cells,"vascular endothelial cells, lymphatic endothelial cells, endothelial progenitor cells",,7,1,"Final Annotation Agent: To annotate the cell type based on the provided ranked marker list, I will follow the outlined steps:

### Step 1: List the Key Functional Markers
- **Cd34**: A well-known marker for hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells. It is involved in cell adhesion and signal transduction.
- **Flt1 (VEGFR1)**: A receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), playing a crucial role in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis.
- **Kdr (VEGFR2)**: Another receptor for VEGF, critical for endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and new blood vessel formation.
- **Pecam1 (CD31)**: An important molecule in leukocyte transmigration and angiogenesis, commonly expressed in endothelial cells.
- **Ptprb (VE-PTP)**: A receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase involved in the regulation of endothelial cell function and blood vessel development.
- **Tek (Tie2)**: A receptor tyrosine kinase that is essential for blood vessel maturation and stability.
- **Vwf (Von Willebrand factor)**: A glycoprotein involved in hemostasis, primarily expressed in endothelial cells and megakaryocytes.

### Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers
- **Cd34, Pecam1, Vwf**: These markers are strongly associated with endothelial cells.
- **Flt1, Kdr, Tek**: These are specific to endothelial cells, particularly those involved in angiogenesis.
- **Ptprb**: While it can be expressed in other cell types, it is predominantly found in endothelial cells.

### Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases
Using databases such as the Human Protein Atlas, PanglaoDB, and literature on scRNA-seq, these markers are consistently associated with endothelial cells. The combination of Cd34, Pecam1, and Vwf is particularly indicative of endothelial lineage.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type
Based on the expression of these markers, the most likely general cell type is **endothelial cells**. These markers are characteristic of cells involved in forming the lining of blood vessels and are crucial for vascular functions.

### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types
1. **Vascular Endothelial Cells**: Given the presence of markers like Kdr, Flt1, and Tek, which are involved in angiogenesis and vascular development, this is the most likely subtype.
2. **Lymphatic Endothelial Cells**: While less likely, some markers like Pecam1 can also be expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells.
3. **Endothelial Progenitor Cells**: Cd34 is a marker for progenitor cells, suggesting a potential for this subtype, although the presence of mature endothelial markers makes this less likely.

The most likely subtype, based on the markers, is **Vascular Endothelial Cells**.

### Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis
The ranked marker list provided is indicative of endothelial cells, with a strong emphasis on markers associated with vascular endothelial function. The presence of Cd34, Pecam1, and Vwf, along with angiogenesis-related markers like Flt1, Kdr, and Tek, supports the identification of these cells as endothelial. The most probable subtype within this general cell type is vascular endothelial cells, given the specific roles of these markers in blood vessel formation and maintenance.

The proposed annotation result is consistent with the provided marker list and the identified cell type. The markers listed, such as Cd34, Flt1, Kdr, Pecam1, Ptprb, Tek, and Vwf, are well-known markers for endothelial cells, particularly those involved in vascular functions. The analysis correctly identifies the general cell type as endothelial cells and further narrows it down to vascular endothelial cells, which is supported by the presence of angiogenesis-related markers like Flt1, Kdr, and Tek.

Proximal tubule cells,proximal tubule epithelial cells,"proximal convoluted tubule cells, proximal straight tubule cells, proximal tubule cells with specialized transport functions",,3,1,"Final Annotation Agent: To annotate the cell type based on the provided ranked marker list from a single-cell tiger kidney dataset, we will follow the outlined steps:

### Step 1: List the Key Functional Markers

1. **Lrp2 (Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2):**
   - **Role:** Lrp2, also known as megalin, is a multiligand endocytic receptor that plays a crucial role in the reabsorption of proteins and other molecules in the proximal tubules of the kidney. It is involved in the uptake of vitamin D-binding protein, albumin, and other ligands.

2. **Pdzk1 (PDZ domain containing 1):**
   - **Role:** Pdzk1 is a scaffolding protein that interacts with various membrane proteins and receptors. It is known to be involved in the regulation of ion transport and is highly expressed in the proximal tubules of the kidney, where it interacts with transporters like the sodium-hydrogen exchanger.

3. **Slco3a1 (Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 3A1):**
   - **Role:** Slco3a1 is part of the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) family, which are involved in the transport of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous organic compounds. It is expressed in the kidney and plays a role in the uptake and clearance of various substances.

### Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers

- **Lrp2 and Pdzk1** are both strongly associated with the proximal tubule cells of the kidney. These markers are indicative of the absorptive and transport functions characteristic of proximal tubular epithelial cells.
- **Slco3a1** is also expressed in the kidney, supporting the role of proximal tubule cells in organic anion transport.

### Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases

- **Human Protein Atlas and Kidney-specific Databases:** Both Lrp2 and Pdzk1 are well-documented markers for proximal tubule cells in the kidney. Slco3a1, while less specific, is consistent with the expression profile of proximal tubule cells.
- **Literature Review:** Studies on kidney cell types consistently show high expression of Lrp2 and Pdzk1 in proximal tubule cells, confirming their role in reabsorption and transport.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type

Based on the expression of Lrp2, Pdzk1, and Slco3a1, the most probable general cell type for this cluster is **proximal tubule epithelial cells** in the kidney.

### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types

1. **Proximal Convoluted Tubule Cells:**
   - **Reasoning:** These cells are characterized by high expression of Lrp2 and Pdzk1, which are involved in reabsorption and transport functions.

2. **Proximal Straight Tubule Cells:**
   - **Reasoning:** While similar to convoluted tubule cells, these cells may have slightly different expression profiles and functional roles, but still express Lrp2 and Pdzk1.

3. **Proximal Tubule Cells with Specialized Transport Functions:**
   - **Reasoning:** These could be a subset of proximal tubule cells with a specific focus on organic anion transport, indicated by Slco3a1 expression.

**Most Likely Subtype:** Proximal Convoluted Tubule Cells, due to the strong expression of Lrp2 and Pdzk1, which are hallmark markers for this subtype.

### Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis

The cluster of cells from the tiger kidney dataset is most likely composed of proximal tubule epithelial cells, specifically proximal convoluted tubule cells. This conclusion is based on the high expression of Lrp2 and Pdzk1, which are key markers for these cells, and the presence of Slco3a1, which supports their role in organic anion transport.
