   - **Role**: Ackr1, also known as DARC (Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines), is involved in binding chemokines and is known for its role in modulating inflammation and immune responses. It is also a receptor for Plasmodium vivax, the malaria parasite.
   
2. **Flt1 (Fms Related Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 1)**:
   - **Role**: Flt1, also known as VEGFR-1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 1), is a receptor for VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) and plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and vascular development.

3. **Selp (Selectin P)**:
   - **Role**: Selp, or P-selectin, is a cell adhesion molecule on the surface of activated endothelial cells and platelets. It plays a significant role in the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of injury and inflammation.

### Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers

- **Ackr1**: Often expressed in endothelial cells, particularly in venular endothelium, and is involved in chemokine binding and transport.
- **Flt1**: Primarily expressed in endothelial cells and is critical for vascular development and angiogenesis.

### Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases

Using scRNA-seq databases and literature, these markers are commonly associated with endothelial cells. Ackr1 and Flt1 are particularly indicative of endothelial cell types due to their roles in vascular biology. Selp further supports this association as it is involved in endothelial cell function during inflammation.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type

Based on the expression of Ackr1, Flt1, and Selp, the most probable general cell type for this cluster is **endothelial cells**. These markers are strongly indicative of cells involved in vascular and inflammatory processes, typical of endothelial cells.

### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types

1. **Venular Endothelial Cells**:
