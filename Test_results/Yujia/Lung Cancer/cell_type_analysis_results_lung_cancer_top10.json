The markers listed, such as PLP1, OPALIN, and MIR219A2, are well-known markers for oligodendrocytes, particularly mature oligodendrocytes involved in myelination. The presence of NKX6-2 supports the potential inclusion of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, but the overall marker profile strongly supports the identification of mature oligodendrocytes as the primary cell type. There is no indication of mixed cell types that would require further investigation. The annotation is well-supported by the marker list and aligns with known biological functions and literature."
