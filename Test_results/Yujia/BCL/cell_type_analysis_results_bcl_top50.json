Here is the validation summary:\n\n1. **Marker Consistency:**\n   - The re-evaluation of the functional markers (CRYAB, ANGPTL2, IL1RAPL1, FGFR2, SOX8, NFASC) has been appropriately conducted. The analysis acknowledges their association with a broader range of cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and other glial cells, which is consistent with their known functions and expression patterns.\n   - The oligodendrocyte-specific markers (OPALIN, MAG, PLP1, OLIG1, CNTN2, NKX6-2) remain consistent with the identification of oligodendrocytes, as previously noted.\n\n2. **Mixed Cell Type Consideration:**\n   - The annotation correctly identifies the presence of a mixed cell population within the cluster, including oligodendrocytes, neurons, and potentially astrocytes or other glial cells. This conclusion is well-supported by the expression of both oligodendrocyte-specific markers and markers associated with other neural and glial cell types.\n   - The identification of sub cell types, such as mature oligodendrocytes, neurons, and astrocytes or other glial cells, is logical and aligns with the expression patterns of the markers.\n\nThe revised annotation provides a clear and accurate representation of the cell types present in the cluster, taking into account the complexity and potential mixed populations. The analysis is thorough and well-supported by the marker data."
