They form a complex known as calprotectin, which is involved in the immune response.\n- **S100A12**: Another member of the S100 family, it is also involved in inflammatory responses and is expressed in granulocytes.\n- **FCN1 (Ficolin-1)**: A protein involved in the innate immune response, particularly in pathogen recognition and clearance. It is typically expressed in monocytes and macrophages.\n- **C1QC**: Part of the complement system, involved in immune complex clearance and inflammation. It is expressed in monocytes and macrophages.\n- **FPR2 (Formyl Peptide Receptor 2)**: A receptor involved in chemotaxis and immune response, expressed in neutrophils and monocytes.\n- **HK3 (Hexokinase 3)**: An enzyme involved in glycolysis, often expressed in cells with high metabolic activity, such as immune cells.\n- **AQP9 (Aquaporin 9)**: A water channel protein expressed in leukocytes, particularly in granulocytes and monocytes, facilitating glycerol and water transport.\n- **MMP19 (Matrix Metallopeptidase 19)**: Involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, expressed in various immune cells, including macrophages.\n\n### Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers\n- **CD1E**: A marker associated with antigen-presenting cells, particularly dendritic cells and some monocytes.\n\n### Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases\nUsing scRNA-seq databases such as the Human Cell Atlas and literature, these markers are predominantly associated with myeloid lineage cells, particularly monocytes and macrophages. The presence of S100A8, S100A9, and FCN1 strongly suggests a myeloid origin.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type\nBased on the expression of these markers, the most likely general cell type is **myeloid cells**, specifically monocytes or macrophages.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types\n1. **Classical Monocytes**: Characterized by high expression of S100A8, S100A9, and FCN1, these cells are involved in inflammatory responses.\n2. **Non-classical Monocytes**: These may also express some of these markers but typically have a different expression profile, with less emphasis on S100 proteins.\n3. **Macrophages**: While they share some markers with monocytes, macrophages are more differentiated and may express additional markers like MMP19.\n\nThe most likely subtype based on the markers is **Classical Monocytes**, given the high expression of S100A8, S100A9, and FCN1.\n\n### Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis\nThe ranked marker list suggests that the cell cluster is most likely composed of myeloid cells, specifically classical monocytes.

        "To annotate the cell type based on the provided ranked marker list, I will follow the outlined steps:\n\n### Step 1: List the Key Functional Markers\n1. **KLRF1 (Killer Cell Lectin Like Receptor F1)**: This gene encodes a receptor involved in the activation of natural killer (NK) cells, which are critical for the innate immune response.\n2. **SH2D1B (SH2 Domain Containing 1B)**: This gene is involved in signaling pathways that regulate immune cell activation, particularly in NK cells and some T cells.\n3. **FGFBP2 (Fibroblast Growth Factor Binding Protein 2)**: Known to be expressed in NK cells, it plays a role in modulating immune responses.\n4. **CX3CR1 (C-X3-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 1)**: This receptor is involved in leukocyte adhesion and migration, often associated with NK cells and some T cell subsets.\n5. **S1PR5 (Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 5)**: This receptor is involved in the migration and circulation of immune cells, particularly NK cells.\n\n### Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers\n1. **KLRF1, SH2D1B, FGFBP2, CX3CR1, S1PR5**: These markers are strongly associated with NK cells, indicating their role in immune surveillance and cytotoxic activity.\n2. **TRDC (T Cell Receptor Delta Constant)**: This gene is a component of the T cell receptor complex, typically found in gamma-delta T cells.\n3. **KIR2DL3 (Killer Cell Immunoglobulin Like Receptor, Two Ig Domains and Long Cytoplasmic Tail 3)**: This gene is part of the KIR family, which is expressed on NK cells and some T cells, involved in the regulation of immune responses.\n4. **TMIGD2 (Transmembrane and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 2)**: Expressed in NK cells and some T cells, involved in immune cell activation.\n5. **ADGRG3 (Adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptor G3)**: While not as specific, it can be expressed in various immune cells, including NK cells.\n6. **KRT86 (Keratin 86)**: Typically associated with epithelial cells, its presence here might be due to contamination or a rare expression in immune cells.\n\n### Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases\nUsing databases such as the Human Cell Atlas, PanglaoDB, and recent literature, the markers KLRF1, SH2D1B, FGFBP2, CX3CR1, S1PR5, and KIR2DL3 are strongly indicative of NK cells. TRDC suggests a possible presence of gamma-delta T cells, but the overall marker profile leans heavily towards NK cells.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type\nBased on the expression of these markers, the most likely general cell type is **Natural Killer (NK) cells**. The presence of KLRF1, SH2D1B, FGFBP2, CX3CR1, and S1PR5 strongly supports this classification.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types\n1. **CD56^dim NK Cells**: These are the most cytotoxic subset of NK cells, characterized by high expression of KLRF1, SH2D1B, and FGFBP2.\n2. **CD56^bright NK Cells**: Typically less cytotoxic but more involved in cytokine production, they may express some of these markers but generally at lower levels.\n3. **Gamma-delta T Cells**: While not NK cells, the presence of TRDC suggests a possible minor population of these cells.\n\nThe most likely subtype based on the markers is **CD56^dim NK Cells** due to the high expression of cytotoxic and activation markers.\n\n### Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis\nThe analysis of the provided marker list suggests that the cell cluster is predominantly composed of Natural Killer (NK) cells, specifically the CD56^dim subset, known for their cytotoxic capabilities. The presence of markers such as KLRF1, SH2D1B, FGFBP2, and CX3CR1 strongly supports this annotation. While there is a minor indication of gamma-delta T cells due to TRDC, the overall profile is consistent with NK cells.\n\nFINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED"
