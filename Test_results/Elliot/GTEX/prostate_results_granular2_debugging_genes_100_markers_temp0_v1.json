        "To annotate the cell type based on the provided ranked marker list, I will follow the outlined steps:\n\n### Step 1: List the Key Functional Markers\n- **CCL21**: A chemokine involved in immune cell trafficking, particularly in lymphoid tissues.\n- **FLT4 (VEGFR-3)**: A receptor involved in lymphangiogenesis, the formation of lymphatic vessels.\n- **LYVE1**: A receptor for hyaluronan, involved in lymphatic endothelial cell function.\n- **PROX1**: A transcription factor critical for lymphatic endothelial cell differentiation.\n- **CD36**: A scavenger receptor involved in lipid metabolism and angiogenesis.\n- **ACKR3 (CXCR7)**: Atypical chemokine receptor involved in cell migration and signaling.\n- **ANGPT2**: Angiopoietin involved in vascular remodeling and lymphatic development.\n- **PDPN (Podoplanin)**: A glycoprotein expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells and involved in cell migration.\n\n### Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers\n- **LYVE1, PROX1, FLT4, PDPN**: These markers are strongly associated with lymphatic endothelial cells.\n- **CCL21**: Often expressed in lymphoid tissues and associated with lymphatic endothelial cells.\n- **ANGPT2**: Involved in lymphatic and blood vessel development, often expressed in endothelial cells.\n- **CD36**: While broadly expressed, it is also found in endothelial cells, including lymphatic types.\n\n### Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases\nUsing databases such as the Human Cell Atlas and literature on scRNA-seq of the prostate, the markers LYVE1, PROX1, FLT4, and PDPN are consistently associated with lymphatic endothelial cells. These markers are not typically expressed in other prostate cell types such as epithelial, stromal, or immune cells.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type\nBased on the expression of LYVE1, PROX1, FLT4, and PDPN, the most probable general cell type is **Lymphatic Endothelial Cells**. These markers are highly specific to this cell type and are involved in lymphatic vessel formation and function.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types\n1. **Lymphatic Endothelial Cells**: The presence of LYVE1, PROX1, FLT4, and PDPN strongly indicates this subtype.\n2. **Vascular Endothelial Cells**: While less likely, some markers like ANGPT2 and CD36 can also be expressed in vascular endothelial cells.\n3. **Immature Lymphatic Endothelial Cells**: Given the presence of developmental markers like PROX1, this could indicate a less differentiated state.\n\nThe most likely subtype based on the markers is **Lymphatic Endothelial Cells**.\n\n### Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis\nThe analysis of the ranked marker list suggests that the cell cluster is most likely composed of lymphatic endothelial cells. This conclusion is supported by the expression of key markers such as LYVE1, PROX1, FLT4, and PDPN, which are specific to lymphatic endothelial cells and are involved in lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic vessel function. The presence of additional markers like CCL21 and ANGPT2 further supports this annotation, as they are involved in lymphatic and vascular processes.\n\n**FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED**"

However, the presence of multiple high-ranking markers specific to lymphatic endothelial cells strongly supports this cell type as the primary annotation. The potential for mixed cell types is noted but not strongly indicated by the marker list.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe annotation of the cell cluster as lymphatic endothelial cells is well-supported by the marker list. The presence of markers like LYVE1, PROX1, FLT4, and PDPN, which are specific to lymphatic endothelial cells, aligns with the proposed annotation. While there is a possibility of mixed cell types, the evidence is not strong enough to warrant further investigation at this stage.\n\nValidation result: VALIDATION PASSED"

The presence of multiple KIRs, NCR1, and cytotoxic granules (e.g., PRF1, GZMB) strongly suggests an NK cell identity.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type\nBased on the expression of these markers, the most likely general cell type is **Natural Killer (NK) cells**. The combination of KIRs, NCR1, and cytotoxic granules is characteristic of NK cells.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types\n1. **Conventional NK Cells (CD56^dim NK cells)**: These are the most abundant NK cell subset in peripheral blood, characterized by high cytotoxic activity and expression of KIRs and CD16.\n2. **CD56^bright NK Cells**: These are less cytotoxic but produce high levels of cytokines like IFNG. They express fewer KIRs compared to CD56^dim NK cells.\n3. **Adaptive NK Cells**: These cells have a memory-like phenotype, often characterized by the expression of NKG2C and specific KIRs, and are involved in responses to viral infections.\n\nThe most likely subtype based on the markers is **Conventional NK Cells (CD56^dim NK cells)**, given the high expression of cytotoxic markers and KIRs.\n\n### Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis\nThe cluster of cells is most likely composed of Natural Killer (NK) cells, specifically the conventional CD56^dim NK cell subtype. This conclusion is supported by the high expression of cytotoxic markers (e.g., PRF1, GZMB), NK cell-specific receptors (e.g., KIRs, NCR1), and other NK-associated markers (e.g., CD244, CD96).
