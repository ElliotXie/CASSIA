        "To validate the annotation result, let's follow the outlined steps:\n\n### Step 1: Marker Consistency\n- The provided marker list includes: COX4I2, DES, FHL5, HSPB7, PSENEN, CACNA1H, GJA4, PDGFRB, LDB3, GPR20.\n- The annotation result uses these markers, so there is consistency between the identified cell type and the provided markers.\n\n### Step 2: Mixed Cell Type Consideration\n- The annotation suggests the presence of smooth muscle cells, with a focus on vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes.\n- The markers DES, PDGFRB, and LDB3 strongly support smooth muscle cells and pericytes.\n- GJA4 is also consistent with smooth muscle and endothelial cells, which supports the annotation of vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes.\n- There is no strong evidence of multiple distinct cell types beyond the suggested smooth muscle cells and pericytes, which are closely related in function and location.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe annotation is consistent with the provided marker list and the identified cell types are well-supported by the markers. There is no strong indication of mixed cell types beyond the related smooth muscle cells and pericytes.\n\nValidation result: VALIDATION PASSED"
