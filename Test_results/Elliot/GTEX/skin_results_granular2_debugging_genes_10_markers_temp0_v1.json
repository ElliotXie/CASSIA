However, the strong presence of ACTA2 and ACTG2 supports the primary annotation of smooth muscle cells.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe annotation primarily identifies smooth muscle cells, specifically vascular smooth muscle cells, based on the strong markers ACTA2 and ACTG2. However, the presence of KIR2DL1 and other non-specific markers suggests potential contamination or a mixed cell population. This should be flagged for further investigation to confirm the purity of the cell cluster.\n\n**Validation result: VALIDATION PASSED**\n\nThe annotation is consistent with the provided markers, but further investigation is recommended to address the potential mixed cell population."

All these markers are present in the provided marker list, which includes SEC14L6, DGAT2L6, PNPLA5, GAL, C3orf80, SULT4A1, AADACL3, CYP4F2, SEC14L4, and ZP1.\n- **Consistency with Identified Cell Type**: The markers used in the annotation are consistent with the identified cell type, sebaceous gland cells, particularly sebocytes. The emphasis on lipid metabolism markers such as SEC14L6, DGAT2L6, and PNPLA5 aligns well with the function of sebocytes in lipid production and secretion.\n\n### Step 2: Mixed Cell Type Consideration\n- The annotation does not strongly suggest the presence of multiple distinct cell types. The markers used predominantly support the identification of sebaceous gland cells, specifically sebocytes. There is no strong evidence from the marker list to suggest a mixed cell population that would require further investigation.\n\nBased on the analysis, the annotation result is consistent with the provided marker list and the identified cell type. There is no indication of mixed cell types that would necessitate further investigation.\n\nValidation result: VALIDATION PASSED"
