Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type\nBased on the expression of these markers, the most probable general cell type is **neuronal cells**. The high expression of neuropeptides (CARTPT, GAL, VIP, NPY), neurofilament proteins (NEFL, NEFM, NEFH), and other neuron-specific markers (UCHL1, PHOX2B, CHRNA3) strongly suggests a neuronal identity.\n\n#### 5.

The top three probable subtypes are enteric neurons, autonomic neurons, and sensory neurons, with enteric neurons being the most likely subtype based on the expression of specific neuropeptides and other neuronal markers.\n\n**FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED**"
