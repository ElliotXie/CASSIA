All markers mentioned in the annotation are present in the marker list.\n- **Functional and Cell Type Marker Consistency:** The markers identified (e.g., MYH7, ACTA1, TNNC1, CKM) are indeed associated with skeletal muscle cells, particularly muscle fibers. The presence of oxidative metabolism markers like COX subunits supports the identification of Type I muscle fibers.\n\n### Step 2: Mixed Cell Type Consideration\n- **Mixed Cell Type Check:** The annotation result focuses on skeletal muscle fibers, particularly Type I muscle fibers. The presence of markers like MYH2 and MYL2, which are also associated with Type IIa muscle fibers, suggests a potential mixed population.
