This confirms that the markers used for annotation are consistent with the provided data.\n\n- **Marker Relevance:** The markers are predominantly associated with T cells, particularly with T-cell activation, differentiation, and function. This supports the annotation of the cell type as T cells.\n\n### Step 2: Mixed Cell Type Consideration\n- **Potential Mixed Populations:** The presence of KLRC1, which is typically associated with NK cells, could suggest a mixed population or a subset of T cells expressing this marker. However, the overall marker profile strongly supports a T-cell identity, particularly effector T cells (CD8+ T cells), as indicated by the presence of EOMES and RUNX3.\n\n- **Conclusion on Mixed Types:** While KLRC1 could indicate a potential mixed population, the strong presence of T-cell markers and the lack of multiple high-ranking markers for distinct cell types suggest that the primary annotation as T cells is appropriate. Further investigation could be warranted to explore the expression of KLRC1 in this context, but it does not necessitate a revision of the current annotation.\n\n### Validation Result\n- **Validation Outcome:** The annotation result is consistent with the provided marker list and the identified cell type is well-supported by the markers.

The markers are consistent with the identified cell type, skeletal muscle fibers, as they are known to be associated with muscle structure and function.\n\n### Step 2: Mixed Cell Type Consideration\n- The annotation primarily supports skeletal muscle fibers, particularly Type I (slow-twitch) muscle fibers, based on the expression of TTN, NEB, and RYR1.\n- There is no strong evidence of multiple distinct cell types supported by several high-ranking markers. The markers TRIM63 and FBXO32 suggest muscle atrophy processes, which are consistent with skeletal muscle context rather than indicating a different cell type.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe annotation is consistent with the provided marker list and the identified cell type.
