While **JCHAIN** and **TNFRSF17** are strong indicators, ensure that other markers also support this conclusion.\n   - Consider the expression levels and co-expression patterns of markers to distinguish between plasma cells, memory B cells, and naive B cells more accurately.\n\nBy addressing these points, the annotation can be revised to provide a more accurate and reliable identification of the cell cluster."
