The presence of metabolic markers like NDUFA4L2 and COX4I2 supports high metabolic activity, which is common in muscle cells.\n\n### Step 2: Mixed Cell Type Consideration\n- The annotation result considers the possibility of mixed cell types, mentioning vascular smooth muscle cells, pericytes, and endothelial cells. However, the analysis strongly supports vascular smooth muscle cells as the primary cell type, with pericytes as a secondary possibility. The mention of endothelial cells is less supported by the overall marker profile.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe annotation result is consistent with the provided marker list and the identified cell type. The analysis appropriately considers the possibility of mixed cell types but concludes with a well-supported primary cell type.\n\nValidation result: VALIDATION PASSED"
