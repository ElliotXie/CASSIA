C14orf180 is mentioned in the marker list but not used in the annotation, which is acceptable as it may not be relevant to the identified cell type.\n- **Consistency with Identified Cell Type**: The markers ADIPOQ, PLIN1, CIDEC, and MEST are indeed strongly associated with adipocytes, particularly white adipocytes.
