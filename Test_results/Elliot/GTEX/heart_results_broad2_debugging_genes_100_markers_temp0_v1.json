This confirms that the markers used for annotation are consistent with the provided data.\n- **Consistency with Identified Cell Type**: The markers identified are consistent with cardiomyocytes, particularly ventricular cardiomyocytes. The presence of contractile proteins (e.g., MYL2, MYH7) and mitochondrial markers supports the annotation of cardiomyocytes, which are known for their high energy demand and contractile function.\n\n### Step 2: Mixed Cell Type Consideration\n- The analysis does not strongly suggest the presence of multiple distinct cell types. The markers predominantly support a single cell type, cardiomyocytes, with a focus on ventricular cardiomyocytes. There is no strong evidence of mixed cell types based on the high-ranking markers provided.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe annotation result is consistent with the provided marker list and the identified cell type.
