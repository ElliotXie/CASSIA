FOXJ1 is a well-established marker for ciliated cells, and the presence of multiple ciliary structural proteins (e.g., DNAI1, DNAH9) supports this identification.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type\nBased on the expression of these markers, the most probable general cell type is **ciliated epithelial cells**. These cells are responsible for moving mucus and trapped particles out of the respiratory tract.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types\n1. **Multiciliated Cells**: These are the most likely subtype, given the high expression of ciliary proteins and FOXJ1.\n2. **Airway Epithelial Cells**: While not all airway epithelial cells are ciliated, the presence of epithelial markers like CDHR3 and CLDN8 suggests this possibility.\n3. **Nasal Epithelial Cells**: Similar to airway epithelial cells, but specifically located in the nasal passages, which also contain ciliated cells.\n\nThe most likely subtype, based on the markers, is **multiciliated cells**.\n\n### Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis\nThe analysis of the ranked marker list suggests that the cell cluster is composed of ciliated epithelial cells, specifically multiciliated cells. This conclusion is supported by the presence of key ciliary structural proteins and the transcription factor FOXJ1, which is essential for cilia formation and function. These cells play a critical role in maintaining respiratory health by facilitating the movement of mucus and debris out of the airways.\n\nFINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED"
