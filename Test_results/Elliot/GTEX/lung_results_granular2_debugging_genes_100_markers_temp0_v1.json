The presence of CCL21 further supports a lymphatic endothelial identity.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type\nBased on the expression of LYVE1, PROX1, FLT4, FOXC2, and KDR, the most probable general cell type is **endothelial cells**, with a strong indication towards **lymphatic endothelial cells** due to the presence of LYVE1 and PROX1.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types\n1. **Lymphatic Endothelial Cells**: The presence of LYVE1, PROX1, FLT4, and FOXC2 strongly suggests this subtype.\n2. **Vascular Endothelial Cells**: KDR and TAL1 suggest a vascular endothelial identity, but the presence of lymphatic markers makes this less likely.\n3. **Endothelial Cells in Lymphoid Tissues**: CCL21 and GPR182 suggest a role in lymphoid tissue, possibly specialized endothelial cells in these regions.\n\nThe most likely subtype based on the markers is **Lymphatic Endothelial Cells**.\n\n### Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis\nThe analysis of the ranked marker list suggests that the cell cluster is most likely composed of lymphatic endothelial cells. This conclusion is supported by the high expression of markers such as LYVE1, PROX1, FLT4, and FOXC2, which are well-known markers for lymphatic endothelial cells.

The presence of markers like MS4A1, CD79A, CD79B, and CD19 strongly suggests a B cell lineage, while JCHAIN, IRF4, and PRDM1 indicate plasma cell differentiation.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type\nBased on the expression of these markers, the most likely general cell type is **B cells**. The presence of plasma cell markers suggests that these B cells may be differentiating into or are already plasma cells.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types\n1. **Plasma Cells**: High expression of JCHAIN, IRF4, and PRDM1, along with other B cell markers, strongly indicates plasma cells.\n2. **Memory B Cells**: Expression of CD19, CD79A, and CD79B, with some markers like FCRL5, which can be found in memory B cells.\n3. **Naive B Cells**: Although less likely due to the presence of plasma cell markers, naive B cells could still be a possibility given the expression of general B cell markers.\n\nThe most likely subtype based on the markers is **Plasma Cells**.\n\n### Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis\nThe analysis of the ranked marker list suggests that the cell cluster is primarily composed of B cells, with a strong indication of plasma cell differentiation. The presence of key markers such as JCHAIN, IRF4, and PRDM1, along with classic B cell markers like MS4A1, CD79A, and CD19, supports this conclusion. The top three probable subtypes are plasma cells, memory B cells, and naive B cells, with plasma cells being the most likely.\n\n**FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED**"

Their presence suggests a role in immune response.\n- **FCER1A, FCER1G**: These are components of the high-affinity IgE receptor, typically found on mast cells and basophils, but also on dendritic cells.\n- **CD1C, CD1E**: These are involved in lipid antigen presentation, often associated with dendritic cells.\n- **AIF1 (Allograft Inflammatory Factor 1)**: Involved in immune response, often expressed in macrophages and microglia.\n- **CX3CR1**: A chemokine receptor involved in leukocyte adhesion and migration, often found on monocytes and macrophages.\n- **LST1**: Involved in immune response, expressed in leukocytes.\n- **TYROBP (DAP12)**: An adaptor protein involved in immune signaling, often associated with myeloid cells.\n- **CD74**: Invariant chain associated with MHC class II, involved in antigen processing and presentation.\n\n### Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers\n- **CD1C**: A marker for dendritic cells, particularly myeloid dendritic cells.\n- **FCER1A**: Often associated with dendritic cells, especially plasmacytoid dendritic cells.\n- **CD79B**: A component of the B-cell receptor complex, indicating B cells.\n- **LILRB2**: An inhibitory receptor found on myeloid cells, including dendritic cells and macrophages.\n- **LYPD2, PLD4**: Less commonly used markers, but can be associated with immune cells.\n- **FAM26F, PTGDR2**: These are less specific but can be expressed in immune cells.\n\n### Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases\nUsing databases such as the Human Cell Atlas and literature on scRNA-seq, the markers like CD1C, FCER1A, and HLA-DRA are strongly indicative of dendritic cells, particularly myeloid dendritic cells.
