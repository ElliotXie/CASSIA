GJA4 and AGT further support this association.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type\nBased on the expression of RGS5, PDGFRB, NOTCH3, and AGT, the most probable general cell type is **vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)** or **pericytes**.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types\n1. **Pericytes**: Given the strong expression of RGS5 and PDGFRB, which are classic pericyte markers.\n2. **Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells**: Supported by the expression of NOTCH3, AGT, and AVPR1A.\n3. **Endothelial Cells**: Although less likely, the presence of GJA4 suggests a possible endothelial component.\n\nThe most likely subtype based on the markers is **pericytes**, due to the strong presence of RGS5 and PDGFRB.\n\n### Step 6: Provide a Concise Summary of Your Analysis\nThe analysis of the ranked marker list suggests that the cell cluster is most likely composed of pericytes, a type of cell associated with the vasculature in the heart. This conclusion is supported by the expression of key markers such as RGS5 and PDGFRB, which are well-documented in the literature and databases as being characteristic of pericytes.\n\nFINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED"

        "To validate the annotation result, let's follow the outlined steps:\n\n### Step 1: Marker Consistency\n- **Marker List Consistency**: All markers mentioned in the annotation result are present in the provided marker list.\n- **Functional Consistency**: The markers RGS5, PDGFRB, NOTCH3, and AGT are indeed associated with vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes, as described. GJA4 is also consistent with its association with endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells.\n\n### Step 2: Mixed Cell Type Consideration\n- The annotation suggests the presence of pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, with a possible minor component of endothelial cells. This is supported by several high-ranking markers (RGS5, PDGFRB, NOTCH3, AGT, GJA4), indicating a potential mixed cell type population.\n- The annotation appropriately flags the possibility of endothelial cells, although it is considered less likely.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe annotation result is consistent with the provided marker list and the known associations of these markers with specific cell types. The potential presence of mixed cell types has been appropriately considered and flagged for further investigation.\n\nValidation result: VALIDATION PASSED"
