**CASSIA** (Collaborative Agent System for Single-cell Interpretable Annotation) is a tool that enhances cell type annotation using multi-agent Large Language Models (LLMs).

## üì∞ News

> **2025-05-05**  
> üìä **CASSIA annotation benchmark is now online!**  
> The latest update introduces a new benchmarking platform that evaluates how different LLMs perform on single-cell annotation tasks, including accuracy and cost.  
> **LLaMA4 Maverick, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and DeepSeekV3** are the top three most balanced options‚Äînearly free!  
> üîß A new **auto-merge** function unifies CASSIA output across different levels, making subclustering much easier.
> üêõ Fixed a bug in the annotation boost agent to improve downstream refinement.

> **2025-04-19**  
> üîÑ **CASSIA adds a retry mechanism and optimized report storage!**  
> The latest update introduces an automatic retry mechanism for failed tasks and optimizes how reports are stored for easier access and management.  
> üé® **The CASSIA logo has been drawn and added to the project!**

> **2025-04-17**  
> üöÄ **CASSIA now supports automatic single-cell annotation benchmarking!**  
> The latest update introduces a new function that enables fully automated benchmarking of single-cell annotation. Results are evaluated automatically using LLMs, achieving performance on par with human experts.  
> **A dedicated benchmark website is coming soon‚Äîstay tuned!**


## üèóÔ∏è Installation (R, for Python tutorial please visit [here](https://github.com/ElliotXie/CASSIA/blob/main/CASSIA_example/CASSIA_python_tutorial.ipynb))

```R
# Install dependencies
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("reticulate")

# Install CASSIA
devtools::install_github("ElliotXie/CASSIA/CASSIA_R")
```

***Note: If the environment is not set up correctly the first time, please restart R and run the code below***

```R
library(CASSIA)
setup_cassia_env()
```



### üîë Set Up API Keys

It should take about 3 minutes to get your API key.

We recommend starting with OpenRouter since it provides access to most models through a single API key.

```R
# For OpenRouter
setLLMApiKey("your_openrouter_api_key", provider = "openrouter", persist = TRUE)

# For OpenAI
setLLMApiKey("your_openai_api_key", provider = "openai", persist = TRUE)

# For Anthropic
setLLMApiKey("your_anthropic_api_key", provider = "anthropic", persist = TRUE)

```

	- [How to get an OpenAI api key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
	- [How to get an Anthropic api key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
	- [How to get an OpenRouter api key](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys)
    - [OpenAI API Documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/)
    - [Anthropic API Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/)
    - [OpenRouter API documentatioon](https://openrouter.ai/docs/quick-start)


## üß¨ Example Data

CASSIA includes example marker data in two formats:
```R
# Load example data
markers_unprocessed <- loadExampleMarkers(processed = FALSE)  # Direct Seurat output
markers_processed <- loadExampleMarkers(processed = TRUE)     # Processed format
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline Usage


```R
# The default provider is set to OpenRouter.

runCASSIA_pipeline(
    output_file_name = "cassia_test",            # Base name for output files
    tissue = "Large Intestine",                   # Tissue type (e.g., "brain")
    species = "Human",              		 # Species (e.g., "human")
    marker = markers_unprocessed,               # Marker data from findallmarker
    max_workers = 4                              # Number of parallel workers
)
```

## ü§ñ Supported Models

You can choose any model for annotation and scoring. Some classic models are listed below. OpenRouter supports most of the current popular models, although some have not been extensively benchmarked in the CASSIA paper ‚Äî feel free to experiment with them.


### OpenRouter
- `google/gemini-2.5-flash`: One of the best-performed low-cost models, comparable with models like gpt-4o (Most recommended)
- `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324`: One of the best-performed open-source models, turns to gives very detailed annotations
- `x-ai/grok-4-fast` One of the best-performed low-cost models.

### OpenAI
- `gpt-4o`: Used in the benchmark

### Anthropic
- `claude-sonnet-4-5`: The latest High-performance model

## üì§ Output

The pipeline generates four key files:
1. Complete Annotation Results CSV File
2. Annotation Summary HTML Report
3. Annotation Boost Agent Report for Low Quality Annotation

## üß∞ Troubleshooting

### Authentication (Error 401)
```R
# Check if API key is set correctly
key <- Sys.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
print(key)  # Should not be empty

# Reset API key if needed
setLLMApiKey("your_api_key", provider = "anthropic", persist = TRUE)
```

### File Errors
- Use absolute paths when necessary
- Check file permissions
- Ensure files aren't open in other programs

### Best Practices
- Keep API keys secure
- Maintain sufficient API credits
