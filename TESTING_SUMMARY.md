# CASSIA Testing and Circular Import Fix Summary

## 1. Circular Import Issue

### Problem

There was a circular import between `main_function_code.py` and `tools_function.py`:
- `main_function_code.py` imported `get_custom_base_url` and `get_custom_api_key` from `tools_function.py`
- `tools_function.py` imported everything (`*`) from `main_function_code.py`

This type of circular dependency can cause:
- Unpredictable initialization behavior
- Import-time errors
- Runtime errors that are difficult to debug

### Solution

The solution involved:

1. **Moving shared functions**: We moved the custom provider functions from `tools_function.py` to `main_function_code.py`:
   - `get_custom_base_url`
   - `get_custom_api_key`
   - `set_custom_base_url`
   - `set_custom_api_key`
   - Shared variables `_custom_base_urls` and `_custom_api_keys`

2. **Updating imports**: We modified imports in `tools_function.py` to explicitly import only needed functions and to reference variables from `main_function_code` properly.

3. **Updating references**: We updated references to the moved functions and variables throughout the codebase.

## 2. Testing Strategy

After fixing the circular import issue, we created a comprehensive test suite to verify the package works correctly:

### Unit Tests

1. **Custom Provider Tests** (`test_custom_providers.py`):
   - Tests for setting and retrieving custom API providers
   - Tests for provider fallback behavior
   - Validating API key handling

2. **Marker Handling Tests** (`test_marker_handling.py`):
   - Tests for marker list parsing
   - Tests for marker data filtering
   - Tests for handling different input formats

3. **Data Handling Tests** (`test_data_handling.py`):
   - Tests for CSV reading/writing
   - Tests for data structure conversions
   - Tests for data validation functions

4. **Integration Tests** (`test_integration.py`):
   - End-to-end tests with mock API responses
   - Testing full annotation pipelines

5. **Tools Function Tests** (`test_tools_function.py`):
   - Tests for the main CASSIA functions in tools_function.py
   - Testing runCASSIA with different parameters
   - Testing batch processing functions
   - Testing marker splitting and standardization

6. **Custom Batch Function Tests** (`test_custom_batch_functions.py`):
   - Tests for custom API providers with batch processing
   - Verifying custom provider credentials are properly passed
   - Testing runCASSIA_batch with custom APIs
   - Testing runCASSIA_score_batch with custom APIs
   - Testing runCASSIA_annotationboost with custom APIs

7. **Direct API Integration Tests** (`test_imports.py` and `test_custom_provider.py`):
   - Direct testing with actual API providers (DeepSeek API)
   - Verifying successful integration with third-party LLM APIs
   - End-to-end annotation with custom providers

### Test Runner

A `run_tests.py` script was created to:
- Automatically discover and run all test files
- Generate a detailed test report
- Simplify the test execution process

### Test Data

We created test data files to support our tests:
- `test_markers.csv`: Sample Seurat format marker data
- `test_results.json`: Sample annotation results

## 3. Test Results

The tests confirmed:

1. The circular import issue was successfully fixed.
2. Custom API provider functionality works as expected.
3. CASSIA can work with multiple API providers:
   - OpenAI
   - Custom OpenAI-compatible APIs (e.g., DeepSeek)
   - Anthropic
   - OpenRouter
4. Batch processing functions correctly pass custom provider information.
5. Direct integration with the DeepSeek API was successful, confirming the custom provider functionality works with real API services.

## 4. Additional Testing Notes

- The NumPy 2.0 compatibility warning is a known issue related to dependencies and doesn't affect the core functionality of CASSIA.
- DeepSeek API was successfully integrated as a custom provider, demonstrating CASSIA's extensibility to work with different LLM providers.
- The custom provider credentials are properly propagated through all functions, including batch processing functions.

## 5. Conclusion

The modifications made to fix the circular import issue maintain all the functionality of CASSIA while improving its code structure. The tests confirm that CASSIA works as expected and can be extended to use various API providers.
