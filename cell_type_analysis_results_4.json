        "### Validation Result\n\n#### 1. Consistency between the identified cell type and the provided markers\n- **CCL21, PROX1, FLT4**: These markers are indeed strongly indicative of lymphatic endothelial cells.\n- **TFF3**: This marker is typically associated with goblet cells and other epithelial cells involved in mucosal protection, which is not consistent with lymphatic endothelial cells.\n- **HOXD3**: This marker is expressed in various cell types during development, including endothelial cells, but it is not specific to lymphatic endothelial cells.\n- **MMRN1, PKHD1L1, TBX1, LRCOL1, GPR182**: These markers are not specifically indicative of lymphatic endothelial cells and are involved in various other functions.\n\n#### 2. Alignment of the sub-cell types with the main cell type\n- The annotation suggests lymphatic endothelial cells as the main cell type, which is consistent with the markers **CCL21, PROX1, and FLT4**.\n- The inclusion of goblet cells as a sub-cell type due to **TFF3** is not aligned with the main cell type of lymphatic endothelial cells.\n- Developing endothelial cells could be a plausible sub-cell type given the expression of **HOXD3**, but it is not specific enough to confirm without additional context.\n\n#### 3. Appropriateness of the annotation given the species and tissue type\n- The species is human, and the tissue type is lung. Lymphatic endothelial cells are present in the lung, so this is appropriate.\n- Goblet cells are also present in the lung, but they are not related to lymphatic endothelial cells.\n\n#### 4. Consideration of the rank of the markers\n- **CCL21, PROX1, FLT4** are high-ranking markers for lymphatic endothelial cells.\n- **TFF3** is a high-ranking marker for goblet cells, which creates a conflict.\n- The other markers (MMRN1, PKHD1L1, TBX1, LRCOL1, GPR182) are not high-ranking for lymphatic endothelial cells.\n\n#### 5. Proper consideration of the additional information provided during onboarding\n- The onboarding context does not provide additional information that would clarify the presence of goblet cells or other non-lymphatic endothelial cell types.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe annotation correctly identifies lymphatic endothelial cells based on the key markers **CCL21, PROX1, and FLT4**. However, the inclusion of goblet cells as a sub-cell type due to **TFF3** is inconsistent with the main cell type. Additionally, the other markers listed do not strongly support the identification of lymphatic endothelial cells.\n\n**VALIDATION FAILED**\n\n**Reason**: The inclusion of goblet cells as a sub-cell type is inconsistent with the main cell type of lymphatic endothelial cells. The other markers listed do not strongly support the identification of lymphatic endothelial cells. The annotation needs to be revised to focus on the markers that are specific to lymphatic endothelial cells and exclude unrelated cell types."

Consistency between the identified cell type and the provided markers:\n- The markers listed (PTPRB, CALCRL, SOX17, ACKR1, BTNL9, EGFL7, TMEM100, CLDN5, RAMP3, LDB2) are all consistent with endothelial cells, particularly those involved in vascular development and function. This is well-supported by the literature and databases referenced.\n\n#### 2. Alignment of the sub-cell types with the main cell type:\n- The sub-cell types identified (Vascular Endothelial Cells, Lymphatic Endothelial Cells, Endothelial Progenitor Cells) are all appropriate subtypes of endothelial cells. The most specific sub-cell type, Vascular Endothelial Cells, is well-supported by the high expression of key markers.\n\n#### 3. Appropriateness of the annotation given the species and tissue type:\n- The species is human, and the tissue type is lung. The markers and the identified cell types are appropriate for endothelial cells in human lung tissue. This is consistent with known biology, as the lung has a rich vascular network requiring endothelial cells.\n\n#### 4. Consideration of the rank of the markers:\n- The higher-ranked markers (PTPRB, CALCRL, SOX17, ACKR1, EGFL7, TMEM100, CLDN5, RAMP3) are all critical for identifying endothelial cells, particularly vascular endothelial cells. The lower-ranked marker, BTNL9, is less specific but does not detract from the overall annotation.\n\n#### 5. Proper consideration of the additional information provided during onboarding:\n- The context provided (human, lung tissue) has been properly considered. The annotation aligns well with the tissue type and species.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe annotation result is consistent with the provided markers, aligns well with the main and sub-cell types, is appropriate for the species and tissue type, and properly considers the rank of the markers and additional information.\n\n**VALIDATION PASSED**"
