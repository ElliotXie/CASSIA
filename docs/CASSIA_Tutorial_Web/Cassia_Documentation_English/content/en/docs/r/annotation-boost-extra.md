title: Annotation Boost Plus (Optional)
weight: 5
---


This agent is an extended version of the annotation boost agent. It performs additional analysis on a specific cluster using a custom analysis task. This function extends the basic annotation capabilities by allowing focused investigation of cluster-specific biological questions using large language models.

### Usage
```r
runCASSIA_annottaionboost_additional_task(
    full_result_path,
    marker,
    output_name,
    cluster_name,
    major_cluster_info,
    num_iterations = 5,
    model = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5",
    provider = "openrouter",
    additional_task
)
```

### Parameter Details

- **`full_result_path`** (character string): Path to the full results CSV file from a previous analysis. Should include the output name with "_full.csv" suffix.
- **`marker`**: Object containing the unprocessed marker data used in the analysis.
- **`output_name`** (character string): Name for the output file generated by this function.
- **`cluster_name`** (character string): Name of the specific cluster to be analyzed (e.g., "cd8-positive, alpha-beta t cell").
- **`major_cluster_info`** (character string): General information about the tissue or system being studied (e.g., "Human Large Intestine").
- **`num_iterations`** (integer): Number of iterations to run the analysis. Defaults to 5.
- **`model`** (character string): Specifies the large language model to use. Recommended: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`.
- **`provider`** (character string): The provider of the model (e.g., "openrouter").
- **`additional_task`** (character string): The custom analysis task to be performed on the cluster (e.g., "infer the state of this T cell cluster").

### Details
This function enhances cluster annotation by performing specialized analysis tasks using large language models. It is particularly useful for investigating specific biological questions about individual clusters. The function integrates marker data with custom analysis goals to provide deeper insights into cluster characteristics.

### Note
The performance of this analysis method has not been extensively benchmarked. Results should be interpreted with caution and verified through other means.

### Example
```r
runCASSIA_annottaionboost_additional_task(
    full_result_path = "output_name_full.csv",
    marker = markers_unprocessed,
    output_name = "T_cell_state",
    cluster_name = "cd8-positive, alpha-beta t cell",
    major_cluster_info = "Human Large Intestine",
    num_iterations = 5,
    model = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5",
    provider = "openrouter",
    additional_task = "infer the state of this T cell cluster"
)
```
