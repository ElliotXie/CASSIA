Welcome to the CASSIA Python vignettes section. Here we provide step-by-step tutorials with real data to help you understand the full workflow and capabilities of CASSIA.

## Available Vignettes

1. **[Basic Annotation](basic-annotation.md)** - Learn how to use CASSIA to annotate cell clusters using marker files. This covers installation, setup, fast mode, batch analysis, and quality scoring.

2. **[Clustering and Annotation](clustering-and-annotation.md)** - A complete workflow starting from raw data using Scanpy. Learn how to cluster single-cell data and annotate it with CASSIA in a seamless pipeline.

3. **[Extended Analysis](extended-analysis.md)** - Learn how to use CASSIA's optional agents. This covers uncertainty quantification, annotation boost, RAG, cell type comparison, and subclustering analysis.

## Getting Started

To get the most out of these vignettes, make sure you have:

1. CASSIA properly installed (see [Setting Up CASSIA](/docs/python/setting-up-cassia))
2. Basic understanding of Python programming
3. Familiarity with single-cell RNA sequencing concepts
