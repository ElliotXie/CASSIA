title: Introduction to Vignettes
---


Welcome to the CASSIA vignettes section. Here we provide step-by-step tutorials with real data to help you understand the full workflow and capabilities of CASSIA.

 
## Available Vignettes

Our vignettes are organized in increasing complexity:
1. **Basic Annotation with Provided Marker Files** - Learn how to use CASSIA to annotate cell clusters when you already have marker genes identified.

2. **Extended Analysis with Optional Agents** - Learn how to use CASSIA's optional agents.

3. **Clustering and Annotation Starting from Raw Seurat Object** - A complete walkthrough of clustering scRNA-seq data and annotating cell types using CASSIA.

## Getting Started

To get the most out of these vignettes, make sure you have:

1. CASSIA properly installed (see [Setting Up CASSIA](/docs/setting-up-cassia))
2. Basic understanding of R programming
3. Familiarity with single-cell RNA sequencing concepts and Seurat
