    ## ASSISTANT
    Based on the provided markers CD19, CD79A, CD79B, this cluster represents B lymphocytes.
    
    **Analysis:**
    - CD19 is a pan-B cell marker expressed throughout B cell development
    - CD79A and CD79B form the B-cell receptor signaling complex
    - High confidence for B cell identification
    
    **Conclusion:** B cells with high confidence. These markers are definitive for B cell lineage.
    
    However, further analysis is needed to determine B cell subtype (naive, memory, or plasma cells).
