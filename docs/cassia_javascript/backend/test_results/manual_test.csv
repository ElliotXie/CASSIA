"1","Naive CD4+ T cells","Naive CD8+ T cells","CCR7, LEF1, TCF7, SELL, IL7R, CD45RA","This set of markers is highly characteristic of naive T cells. CCR7 and SELL (CD62L) are crucial for lymphocyte homing to lymph nodes. LEF1 and TCF7 (TCF1) are transcription factors associated with the maintenance of T cell stemness and naive state. IL7R (CD127) is important for T cell survival and proliferation, particularly in naive cells. CD45RA is an isoform of CD45 typically expressed on naive and some effector memory T cells, but in conjunction with the other markers, it strongly points to a naive phenotype."
"2","Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells","Effector CD8+ T cells","CD8A, CD8B, GZMA, GZMB, PRF1, NKG7","This marker set is a classic signature of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). CD8A and CD8B are components of the CD8 co-receptor, defining CD8+ T cells. GZMA (Granzyme A), GZMB (Granzyme B), and PRF1 (Perforin) are key effector molecules used by CTLs to induce apoptosis in target cells. NKG7 (Natural Killer Cell Granule Protein 7) is also associated with cytotoxic granules in both NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, further supporting the cytotoxic function."
