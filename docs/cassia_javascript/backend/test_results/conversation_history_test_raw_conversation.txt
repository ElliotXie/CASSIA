## USER


You are a careful senior computational biologist called in whenever an annotation needs deeper scrutiny, disambiguation, or simply a second opinion. Your job is to (1) assess the current annotation's robustness and (2) propose up to three decisive follow‑up checks that the executor can run (e.g., examine expression of key positive or negative markers). You should do a good job or 10 grandma are going to be in danger. You never rush to conclusions and are always careful.

Context Provided to You:

Cluster summary：Human intestinal scRNA-seq with previous B cell analysis

Top ranked markers (high → low)：
 IGLL5, JCHAIN, IGLC3

Prior annotation results：
 Here's a summary of the prior cell type annotation analysis:

**Previously Identified Cell Type**: B lymphocytes

**Key Supporting Markers**:
*   **CD19**: Pan-B cell marker, expressed throughout B cell development.
*   **CD79A & CD79B**: Components of the B-cell receptor signaling complex.

**Alternative Hypotheses**: No alternative cell types were explicitly considered due to the definitive nature of the identified markers for B cell lineage.

**Remaining Uncertainties**: The specific subtype of B cells (e.g., naive, memory, or plasma cells) could not be determined from the analyzed markers and requires further investigation.

What you should do:

1. Brief Evaluation – One concise paragraph that:

    - Highlights strengths, ambiguities, or contradictions in the current call.

    - Notes if a mixed population, doublets, or transitional state might explain the data.

2. Design up to 3 follow‑up checks (cell types or biological hypotheses):

    - When listing genes for follow-up checks, use the <check_genes>...</check_genes> tags.
    - **CRITICAL FORMATTING FOR <check_genes>:**
        - Inside the tags, provide *ONLY* a comma-separated list of official HGNC gene symbols.
        - Example: `<check_genes>GENE1,GENE2,GENE3</check_genes>` (no extra spaces, no newlines within the list, no numbering or commentary *inside* the tags).
        - Strict adherence to this format is ESSENTIAL for the analysis to proceed.
    - Include both positive and negative markers if that will clarify the call.

    - Including reasoning: why these genes, and what pattern would confirm or refute the hypothesis.

3. Upon receiving gene expression results, based on the current hypothesis, further your analysis, genearte new hypothesis to validate if you think necessary. Continue Step 2 iteratively until the cluster is confidently annotated. Once finalized, output the single line:
"FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED"
Then provide a conclusion paragraph that includes:

1.The final cell type
2.Confidence level (high, medium, or low)
3.Key markers supporting your conclusion
4.Alternative possibilities only if the confidence is not high, and what should the user do next.

## ASSISTANT

Evaluation
The current annotation as "B lymphocytes" is supported by the presence of pan-B cell markers CD19, CD79A, and CD79B. However, the top-ranked markers IGLL5, JCHAIN, and IGLC3 are highly suggestive of plasma cells or plasmablasts, which are terminally differentiated B cells. This creates a potential ambiguity regarding the specific B cell subtype, as these top markers are not typical of general B lymphocytes but rather a specific, late-stage differentiation state. The previous analysis's inability to determine the specific B cell subtype is a significant remaining uncertainty that needs to be addressed.

celltype to check 1

<check_genes>IGLL5,JCHAIN,IGLC3,CD19,CD79A,CD79B,CD27,CD38,SDC1,MZB1</check_genes>

<reasoning>
Given the high expression of IGLL5, JCHAIN, and IGLC3, a strong hypothesis is that this cluster represents plasma cells or plasmablasts. We need to confirm the expression of established plasma cell markers such as CD27, CD38, SDC1 (CD138), and MZB1. Concurrently, we should assess the expression of pan-B cell markers like CD19, CD79A, and CD79B. Plasma cells typically downregulate CD19 and CD79A/B as they differentiate, so a low or absent expression of these markers alongside high expression of plasma cell markers would strongly support a plasma cell identity. Conversely, high expression of both pan-B cell markers and plasma cell markers might suggest plasmablasts, which are transitional.
</reasoning>

celltype to check 2

<check_genes>MS4A1,CD20,CD27,IGHM,IGHD,CD38,FOXP1,PAX5</check_genes>

<reasoning>
To differentiate between naive B cells, memory B cells, and plasmablasts/plasma cells, we should examine markers associated with these distinct B cell states. MS4A1 (CD20) is a pan-B cell marker typically downregulated in plasma cells. CD27 is expressed on memory B cells and plasmablasts/plasma cells. IGHM and IGHD are characteristic of naive B cells. FOXP1 and PAX5 are transcription factors crucial for B cell identity, with PAX5 being downregulated in plasma cells. High CD20, IGHM, and IGHD would suggest naive B cells, while high CD20 and CD27 would suggest memory B cells. Low CD20 and PAX5, with high CD27 and CD38, would further support a plasma cell/plasmablast identity.
</reasoning>

hypothesis to check 3

<check_genes>CD3E,CD14,FCGR3A,CD68,EPCAM,KRT18,PTPRC</check_genes>

<reasoning>
While the B cell lineage is strongly indicated, it is prudent to rule out potential contamination from other immune or non-immune cells, or even doublets. We should check for the absence of markers for T cells (CD3E), monocytes/macrophages (CD14, FCGR3A, CD68), and epithelial cells (EPCAM, KRT18). PTPRC (CD45) should be expressed as a pan-leukocyte marker. The absence of these non-B cell markers would strengthen the confidence in the B cell lineage and allow us to focus solely on B cell subtypes.

## ASSISTANT

Evaluation
The previous analysis identified the cluster as B lymphocytes based on CD19, CD79A, and CD79B. However, the top-ranked markers IGLL5, JCHAIN, and IGLC3 are highly indicative of plasma cells, a terminally differentiated B cell subtype. This discrepancy suggests that while the B cell lineage is likely correct, the specific subtype is misidentified or underspecified. The current data points towards a more differentiated B cell state than a general B lymphocyte population, necessitating a deeper investigation into plasma cell characteristics.

celltype to check 1

<check_genes>IGLL5,JCHAIN,IGLC3,SDC1,MZB1</check_genes>

<reasoning>
Given that IGLL5, JCHAIN, and IGLC3 are already top markers, we should focus on confirming the plasma cell identity by checking for other canonical plasma cell markers. SDC1 (CD138) and MZB1 are highly specific for plasma cells. High expression of these genes, in conjunction with the already observed top markers, would strongly support a plasma cell annotation.
</reasoning>

celltype to check 2

<check_genes>CD19,CD79A,CD79B,MS4A1,PAX5</check_genes>

<reasoning>
Plasma cell differentiation involves the downregulation of many pan-B cell markers. We need to assess the expression levels of CD19, CD79A, CD79B, MS4A1 (CD20), and PAX5. If this cluster is indeed plasma cells, we would expect low or absent expression of these genes, as they are typically lost during terminal differentiation from B cells to plasma cells. This would provide crucial negative evidence to distinguish plasma cells from earlier B cell stages.
</reasoning>

hypothesis to check 3

<check_genes>CD3E,CD14,FCGR3A,EPCAM,KRT18</check_genes>

<reasoning>
To ensure the purity of the cluster and rule out potential contamination or doublets, it is essential to confirm the absence of markers for other major cell types. We should check for the absence of T cell markers (CD3E), myeloid markers (CD14, FCGR3A), and epithelial cell markers (EPCAM, KRT18). The absence of these markers would reinforce the specificity of the cluster to the B cell lineage and allow us to confidently proceed with subtyping within that lineage.

Evaluation
The initial annotation as "B lymphocytes" was based on pan-B cell markers, but the top-ranked genes (IGLL5, JCHAIN, IGLC3) strongly suggested a plasma cell identity. Subsequent checks aimed to confirm this by looking for other plasma cell markers (SDC1, MZB1) and the expected downregulation of pan-B cell markers (CD19, CD79A, CD79B, MS4A1, PAX5). However, the current information indicates that *none* of these critical genes are in the differential expression list. This lack of information on key positive and negative markers for both general B cells and plasma cells makes it impossible to confidently confirm or refute the plasma cell hypothesis, or even the initial B cell annotation. Without expression data for these crucial markers, any conclusion would be speculative.

FINAL ANNOTATION COMPLETED
The final cell type cannot be confidently determined with the provided information. The confidence level is low. The initial markers (IGLL5, JCHAIN, IGLC3) suggest plasma cells, but the absence of differential expression data for these and other critical B cell and plasma cell markers (e.g., CD19, CD79A, CD79B, SDC1, MZB1, MS4A1, PAX5) prevents a definitive conclusion. Alternative possibilities include a general B cell population, a specific B cell subtype (e.g., naive, memory), or even a mixed population. The user should re-evaluate the differential expression analysis to include these critical markers or perform targeted gene expression analysis for them to enable proper cell type annotation.
