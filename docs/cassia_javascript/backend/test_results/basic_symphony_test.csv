"google/gemini-2.5-flash","Dr. Ada Lovelace","peripheral blood","human","initial","success","95","This marker set provides strong evidence for the identification of T cells. CD3D and CD3E are both components of the CD3 complex, which is universally expressed on the surface of all T cells, regardless of their developmental stage or subset. Their presence is highly indicative of a T cell lineage. CD4 is a co-receptor expressed on helper T cells, a major subset of T cells. While its presence would point towards a T helper cell, its absence doesn't rule out other T cell subsets (e.g., cytotoxic T cells which express CD8). The absence of CD19 and CD79A, which are specific markers for B cells, further strengthens the hypothesis that the cells in question are T cells by excluding the B cell lineage. Therefore, the combination of pan-T cell markers and one major T cell subset marker, coupled with the absence of B cell markers, makes a very compelling case for T cells.","90","This marker set offers good indicators for the identification of B cells, primarily through the presence of CD19 and CD79A. CD19 is a pan-B cell marker expressed on virtually all stages of B cell development from pro-B cells to mature B cells, making it a highly reliable marker for B lymphocytes. CD79A (also known as Ig alpha) is a component of the B cell receptor (BCR) complex, and its expression is also highly specific to B cells. The absence of CD3D and CD3E, which are pan-T cell markers, provides crucial negative evidence, ruling out the T cell lineage. The absence of CD4 further supports this, as CD4 is characteristic of helper T cells. While the presence of CD19 and CD79A are highly specific, a more comprehensive B cell panel might include additional markers like CD20 or surface immunoglobulin for even stronger confirmation and to delineate specific B cell subsets. However, for a basic identification, the provided markers are highly effective.","N/A"
"deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324","Dr. Alan Turing","peripheral blood","human","initial","success","95","The marker set strongly matches T cells due to the presence of CD3D and CD3E, which are critical components of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex and are highly specific to T cells. Additionally, CD4 is a marker for helper T cells, further supporting the match. CD19 and CD79A are B cell-specific markers and are absent in T cells, but their inclusion does not detract from the strong T cell signal provided by CD3D, CD3E, and CD4.","85","The marker set matches B cells well due to the presence of CD19 and CD79A, which are highly specific to B cells. CD19 is a pan-B cell marker, and CD79A is part of the B cell receptor (BCR) complex. However, CD3D, CD3E, and CD4 are T cell markers and are not expressed in B cells, which reduces the specificity of the set for B cells. Despite this, the inclusion of CD19 and CD79A provides a strong B cell signal.","N/A"
"x-ai/grok-3-mini-beta","Dr. Marie Curie","peripheral blood","human","initial","success","70","The marker set includes CD3D, CD3E, CD4, CD19, and CD79A. For T cells, which are a major subset of lymphocytes in human peripheral blood, the key markers are those associated with T cell receptor signaling and co-receptors.  

- CD3D: This is a core component of the CD3 complex, which is essential for T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling. It is highly specific and directly relevant to T cells, making it a strong match.  
- CD3E: Similar to CD3D, this is another subunit of the CD3 complex and is a hallmark marker for T cells. It is highly relevant and supports T cell identification.  
- CD4: This marker is expressed on helper T cells (a subset of T cells) and aids in MHC class II interactions. It is relevant for T cells, particularly in distinguishing T helper subsets, but it is not universal to all T cells (e.g., absent in cytotoxic T cells).  
- CD19: This is a B cell-specific marker involved in B cell receptor signaling and is not expressed on T cells. Its presence in the set introduces irrelevant noise, reducing the overall match quality.  
- CD79A: This is part of the B cell receptor complex and is specific to B cells. It has no relevance to T cells and further dilutes the marker set's specificity.  

Overall, out of the five markers, three (CD3D, CD3E, and CD4) are directly relevant to T cells, while the other two (CD19 and CD79A) are associated with B cells and could lead to misidentification. This results in a partial match, as the set captures core T cell markers but includes extraneous ones that are not applicable. The relevant markers are sufficient for basic T cell identification in flow cytometry or immunophenotyping, but the inclusion of B cell markers lowers the precision.","40","The marker set includes CD3D, CD3E, CD4, CD19, and CD79A. For B cells, which are another key lymphocyte subset in human peripheral blood, the primary markers are those involved in B cell receptor signaling.  

- CD3D: This is a T cell-specific marker and has no role in B cell biology. It is irrelevant and could confuse B cell identification.  
- CD3E: As with CD3D, this is part of the T cell receptor complex and is not expressed on B cells, making it completely unrelated.  
- CD4: While CD4 can be expressed on some immune cells, it is primarily associated with T helper cells and not B cells. Thus, it is irrelevant for B cell profiling.  
- CD19: This is a quintessential B cell marker, involved in B cell activation and development. It is highly specific and directly relevant, strengthening the match for B cells.  
- CD79A: This is a component of the B cell receptor complex and is essential for B cell function. It is highly relevant and specific to B cells.  

In total, only two markers (CD19 and CD79A) are relevant to B cells, while the other three (CD3D, CD3E, and CD4) are T cell-associated and do not contribute to B cell identification. This results in a poor overall match, as the set is heavily skewed toward T cell markers, potentially leading to inaccurate B cell isolation or analysis in techniques like flow cytometry. The relevant markers are sufficient for basic B cell detection, but the dominance of irrelevant markers significantly undermines the set's utility.","N/A"
