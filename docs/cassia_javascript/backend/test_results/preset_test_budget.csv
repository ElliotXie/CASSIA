"google/gemini-2.5-flash","Dr. Ada Lovelace","blood","human","initial","success","95","The marker set includes CD3D, which is a core component of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex and is constitutively expressed on the surface of all mature T cells. Its robust presence is a hallmark of the T cell lineage. The other markers, CD19 and CD79A, are B cell specific markers. CD19 is a pan-B cell marker expressed on the surface of B lymphocytes from early pre-B cells through to plasma blasts. CD79A (also known as Ig alpha) is part of the B cell receptor (BCR) complex and is expressed intracellularly in early B cell development and on the surface of mature B cells in association with CD79B. Their absence or low expression would be expected on T cells. The strong positive presence of CD3D alone is highly indicative of T cells.","98","The marker set includes CD19, a widely recognized and highly specific pan-B cell marker expressed throughout most stages of B cell development. It also includes CD79A, which is an integral component of the B cell receptor (BCR) complex and is crucial for signal transduction in B cells. The co-expression of CD19 and CD79A is a definitive characteristic of B lymphocytes. CD3D, the third marker in the set, is a specific T cell marker. Its absence or very low expression in a population positive for CD19 and CD79A further strengthens the identification of B cells, as it rules out T cell contamination. The combination of two strong positive B cell markers and the explicit absence of a T cell marker makes this an excellent match for B cells.","N/A"
"deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324","Dr. Alan Turing","blood","human","initial","success","70","The marker set includes CD3D, which is a highly specific marker for T cells as it is part of the T cell receptor complex. This strongly indicates the presence of T cells. However, the set also includes CD19 and CD79A, which are B cell markers and are not relevant to T cells. While CD3D alone provides strong evidence for T cells, the inclusion of irrelevant markers slightly detracts from the overall match quality.","85","The marker set includes CD19 and CD79A, both of which are well-established markers for B cells. CD19 is a surface marker highly specific to B cells, while CD79A is part of the B cell receptor complex. The presence of these markers strongly supports the identification of B cells. However, CD3D is a T cell marker and is irrelevant to B cells, which slightly reduces the specificity of the marker set for B cells.","N/A"
"x-ai/grok-3-mini-beta","Dr. Marie Curie","blood","human","initial","success","33","T cells are a major subset of lymphocytes in human blood, primarily involved in cell-mediated immunity, and are typically identified by markers such as CD3 (including CD3D), CD4, CD8, or TCR components. Evaluating the marker set (CD3D, CD19, CD79A) against T cells:  

- **CD3D**: This marker is highly relevant and specific for T cells, as it forms part of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex. Its presence in the marker set strongly supports a match for T cells, as CD3D is expressed on most mature T cells and is a standard identifier in T cell isolation and analysis.  

- **CD19**: This marker is not relevant for T cells. CD19 is a B cell-specific surface protein involved in B cell signaling and activation. Its inclusion in the marker set detracts from the overall match, as it is not expressed on T cells and could lead to confusion or misidentification if used in experimental contexts.  

- **CD79A**: This marker is also irrelevant for T cells. CD79A is a key component of the B cell antigen receptor complex and is expressed primarily on B cells. Its presence in the marker set further reduces the specificity, as it has no role in T cell biology.  

Overall, the marker set only partially matches T cells, with just one out of three markers (CD3D) being appropriate. This indicates a poor fit, as an ideal marker set for T cells would include markers like CD3D along with others such as CD4 or CD8, without B cell-specific markers that could dilute specificity.","67","B cells are lymphocytes responsible for humoral immunity, producing antibodies, and are commonly identified by markers such as CD19, CD20, CD79A, or surface immunoglobulin. Evaluating the marker set (CD3D, CD19, CD79A) against B cells:  

- **CD3D**: This marker is not relevant for B cells. CD3D is specific to T cells as part of the TCR complex and is not expressed on B cells. Its inclusion in the marker set introduces noise and reduces the overall match quality, as it could falsely suggest T cell contamination or overlap.  

- **CD19**: This marker is highly relevant and specific for B cells, serving as a primary identifier from the early stages of B cell development through maturation. It is a strong positive indicator, and its presence in the marker set significantly supports a match for B cells.  

- **CD79A**: This marker is also highly relevant for B cells, as it is a signaling component of the B cell receptor. It is commonly used alongside CD19 for B cell detection and is expressed on most B cell subsets. Its inclusion strengthens the match.  

Overall, the marker set shows a moderate match for B cells, with two out of three markers (CD19 and CD79A) being appropriate. This is better than for T cells, but the presence of CD3D (a T cell marker) makes the set less specific, potentially leading to inaccuracies in cell type identification if used in isolation. An ideal marker set for B cells would focus exclusively on B cell markers like CD19, CD79A, and CD20.","N/A"
