## 🏗️ Installation

```R
# Install dependencies
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("reticulate")

# Install CASSIA
devtools::install_github("ElliotXie/CASSIA/CASSIA_R")
```

***Note: If the environment is not set up correctly the first time, please restart R and run the code below***

```R
library(CASSIA)
setup_cassia_env()
```



### 🔑 Set Up API Keys

It should take about 3 minutes to get your API key.

We recommend starting with OpenRouter since it provides access to most models through a single API key.

```R
# For OpenRouter
setLLMApiKey("your_openrouter_api_key", provider = "openrouter", persist = TRUE)

# For OpenAI
setLLMApiKey("your_openai_api_key", provider = "openai", persist = TRUE)

# For Anthropic
setLLMApiKey("your_anthropic_api_key", provider = "anthropic", persist = TRUE)

# For custom OpenAI-compatible APIs (e.g., DeepSeek)
setLLMApiKey("your_deepseek_api_key", provider = "https://api.deepseek.com", persist = TRUE)

# For local LLMs - no API key needed (e.g., Ollama)
setLLMApiKey(provider = "http://localhost:11434/v1", persist = TRUE)
```

> **Custom APIs**: CASSIA supports any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. Simply use the base URL as the provider parameter.
> **Local LLMs**: For data privacy and zero API costs, use local LLMs like Ollama or LM Studio. No API key required for localhost URLs.

## 🧬 Example Data

CASSIA includes example marker data in two formats:
```R
# Load example data
markers_unprocessed <- loadExampleMarkers(processed = FALSE)  # Direct Seurat output
markers_processed <- loadExampleMarkers(processed = TRUE)     # Processed format
```

## ⚙️ Pipeline Usage


```R
# The default provider is set to OpenRouter.

runCASSIA_pipeline(
    output_file_name = "cassia_test",            # Base name for output files
    tissue = "Large Intestine",                   # Tissue type (e.g., "brain")
    species = "Human",              		 # Species (e.g., "human")
    marker = markers_unprocessed,               # Marker data from findallmarker
    max_workers = 4                              # Number of parallel workers
)
```

## 🤖 Supported Models

You can choose any model for annotation and scoring. Some classic models are listed below. OpenRouter supports most of the current popular models, although some have not been extensively benchmarked in the CASSIA paper — feel free to experiment with them.



### OpenAI
- `gpt-5.1`: Balanced option (Recommended)
- `gpt-4o`: Used in the benchmark

### OpenRouter
- `google/gemini-2.5-flash`: One of the best-performing low-cost models, comparable with models like gpt-4o (Recommended)
- `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324`: One of the best-performing open-source models, which gives very detailed annotations
- `x-ai/grok-4-fast`: One of the best-performing low-cost models.

### Anthropic
- `claude-sonnet-4-5`: The latest best-performing model (Most recommended)

## 📤 Output

The pipeline generates four key files:
1. Complete Annotation Results CSV File
2. Annotation Summary HTML Report
3. Annotation Boost Agent Report for Low Quality Annotation
