## 🏗️ Installation

```R
# Install dependencies
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("reticulate")

# Install CASSIA
devtools::install_github("ElliotXie/CASSIA/CASSIA_R")
```

If you have network issues installing from GitHub, you can install from source:

```R
# Install from downloaded source package
install.packages("path/to/CASSIA_1.3.2.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

Download source package: [CASSIA_1.3.2.tar.gz](https://github.com/ElliotXie/CASSIA/raw/main/CASSIA_source_R/CASSIA_1.3.2.tar.gz)

***Note: If the environment is not set up correctly the first time, please restart R and run the code below***

```R
library(CASSIA)
setup_cassia_env()
```



### 🔑 Set Up API Key

It should take about 3 minutes to get your API key.

**You only need one API key to use CASSIA.** We recommend OpenRouter since it provides access to most models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) through a single API key — no need to sign up for multiple providers.

```R
# For OpenRouter
setLLMApiKey("your_openrouter_api_key", provider = "openrouter", persist = TRUE)

# For OpenAI
setLLMApiKey("your_openai_api_key", provider = "openai", persist = TRUE)

# For Anthropic
setLLMApiKey("your_anthropic_api_key", provider = "anthropic", persist = TRUE)

# For custom OpenAI-compatible APIs (e.g., DeepSeek)
setLLMApiKey("your_deepseek_api_key", provider = "https://api.deepseek.com", persist = TRUE)

# For local LLMs - no API key needed (e.g., Ollama)
setLLMApiKey(provider = "http://localhost:11434/v1", persist = TRUE)
```

> **Custom APIs**: CASSIA supports any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. Simply use the base URL as the provider parameter.

> **Local LLMs**: For data privacy and zero API costs, use local LLMs like Ollama or LM Studio. No API key required for localhost URLs.

## 🧬 Example Data

CASSIA includes example marker data in two formats:
```R
# Load example data
markers_unprocessed <- loadExampleMarkers(processed = FALSE)  # Direct Seurat output
markers_processed <- loadExampleMarkers(processed = TRUE)     # Processed format
```

## ⚙️ Quick Start

```R
# Core annotation
runCASSIA_batch(
    marker = markers_unprocessed,                # Marker data from FindAllMarkers
    output_name = "cassia_results",              # Output file name
    tissue = "Large Intestine",                  # Tissue type
    species = "Human",                           # Species
    model = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6",       # Model to use
    provider = "openrouter",                     # API provider
    max_workers = 4                              # Number of parallel workers
)
```

> **Want even better results?** Use `runCASSIA_pipeline()` which adds automatic quality scoring and the AnnotationBoost agent for difficult clusters. See [complete documentation](https://docs.cassia.bio/en) for details.

## 🤖 Supported Models

You can choose any model for annotation and scoring. CASSIA also supports custom providers (e.g., DeepSeek) and local open-source models (e.g., `gpt-oss:20b` via Ollama).

Some classic models are listed below. OpenRouter supports most popular models — feel free to experiment.



### OpenAI
- `gpt-5.4`: Balanced option (Recommended)
- `gpt-4o`: Used in the benchmark

### OpenRouter
- `openai/gpt-5.4`: Best-performing model via OpenRouter (no identity verification needed, unlike direct OpenAI API) (Recommended)
- `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`: Best-performing model via OpenRouter (Recommended)
- `google/gemini-3-flash-preview`: One of the best-performing low-cost models
- `x-ai/grok-4.20-beta`: One of the best-performing low-cost models.

### Anthropic
- `claude-sonnet-4-6`: The latest best-performing model (Most recommended)

### Other Providers
These models can be used via their own APIs. See [Custom API Providers](https://docs.cassia.bio/en/docs/r/setting-up-cassia/#custom-api-providers) for setup.
- `deepseek-chat` (DeepSeek v3.2): High performance, very affordable. Provider: `https://api.deepseek.com`
- `glm-5` (GLM 5): Fast and cost-effective. Provider: `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/`
- `kimi-k2.5` (Kimi K2.5): Strong reasoning capabilities. Provider: `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1`

### Local LLMs
- `gpt-oss:20b`: Can run locally via Ollama. Good for large bulk analysis with acceptable accuracy. See [Local LLMs](https://docs.cassia.bio/en/docs/r/setting-up-cassia/#local-llms-ollama-lm-studio) for setup.
