      "Feedback: The proposed annotation suggests that the cell cluster is most likely composed of endothelial cells, with a strong indication towards cardiac endothelial cells. However, there are several inconsistencies and considerations that need to be addressed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Marker Consistency**:\n",
      "   - The marker list provided includes ANO2, SLC5A4, AC114757.1, LDB2, PREX2, AL353138.1, ST6GALNAC3, PTCHD4, PTPRB, and TLL1. These markers are indeed present in the analysis.\n",

      "1. **ANO2 (Anoctamin 2)**: Typically associated with sensory neurons and epithelial cells, particularly in the olfactory and other sensory systems.\n",
      "2. **SLC5A4 (Solute Carrier Family 5 Member 4)**: Involved in glucose transport, often found in epithelial cells.\n",
      "3. **ST6GALNAC3 (ST6 N-Acetylgalactosaminide Alpha-2,6-Sialyltransferase 3)**: Involved in glycoprotein sialylation, which can be relevant in various cell types, including epithelial and neuronal cells.\n",
      "4. **PTCHD4 (Patched Domain Containing 4)**: Involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, relevant in developmental processes and various cell types.\n",

      "### Step 1: List the Key Functional Markers\n",
      "The provided list consists of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) and pseudogenes, which are typically not directly associated with specific cellular functions or pathways. These markers are often less characterized in terms of functional roles compared to protein-coding genes. Therefore, we will not be able to extract functional roles directly from these markers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers\n",
      "Similarly, the list consists of non-coding RNA and pseudogenes, which are not typically used as direct markers for specific cell types. These markers are often used in combination with other protein-coding genes to provide context in scRNA-seq datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases\n",
      "Given the nature of the markers (non-coding RNA and pseudogenes), they are less likely to be directly annotated in common scRNA-seq databases such as the Human Cell Atlas or PanglaoDB. However, these markers might be part of larger gene expression profiles that are characteristic of certain cell types or states.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Determine the Possible Tissue Type\n",
      "Without direct protein-coding markers, determining the tissue type is challenging. However, non-coding RNAs can be tissue-specific or associated with certain cellular states. We would need to cross-reference these markers with any available literature or datasets that might have characterized these specific non-coding RNAs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type\n",
      "Given the lack of direct cell type markers, it is difficult to ascertain the general cell type. Typically, non-coding RNAs might be involved in regulatory roles, which could suggest a role in stem cells or progenitor cells, where regulation of gene expression is crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 6: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types\n",

The markers CEACAM6, MUC15, SLPI, and TACSTD2 are indeed associated with epithelial cells, particularly those involved in secretory functions, which aligns with the identification of goblet cells as the most likely subtype. The analysis correctly considers the functional roles of the markers and cross-references known databases to support the annotation. There is no indication of mixed cell types strongly supported by several high-ranking markers, so the annotation is valid as presented.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Step 1: List the Key Functional Markers\n",
      "- **ZNF229**: Zinc finger proteins are often involved in transcriptional regulation. ZNF229 may play a role in gene expression modulation.\n",
      "- **UGT2B7**: This gene encodes a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family, which is involved in the detoxification of drugs and endogenous compounds.\n",
      "- **ATP6V0A4**: Part of the vacuolar ATPase complex, involved in acidifying intracellular compartments, crucial for processes like protein degradation and neurotransmitter release.\n",
      "- **POLD2**: A subunit of DNA polymerase delta, involved in DNA replication and repair.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: List the Key Cell Type Markers\n",
      "- **CEACAM6**: Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 is often associated with epithelial cells and is known to be overexpressed in certain cancers, such as colorectal and pancreatic cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Cross-reference Known Databases\n",
      "- **ZNF229** and **CEACAM6** are often found in epithelial tissues, particularly in the context of cancer.\n",
      "- **UGT2B7** is expressed in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, where detoxification processes are prominent.\n",
      "- **ATP6V0A4** is expressed in kidney intercalated cells and is involved in acid-base homeostasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Determine the Possible Tissue Type\n",
      "Given the expression of **CEACAM6** and **UGT2B7**, the tissue type is likely epithelial, possibly from the gastrointestinal tract or liver, where detoxification and cell adhesion are critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Determine the Most Probable General Cell Type\n",
      "The presence of **CEACAM6** strongly suggests an epithelial cell type, possibly involved in secretory or absorptive functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 6: Identify the Top 3 Most Probable Sub Cell Types\n",
      "1. **Gastrointestinal Epithelial Cells**: Given the expression of **UGT2B7** and **CEACAM6**, these cells are likely involved in absorption and detoxification.\n",
      "2. **Hepatocytes**: While not all markers align perfectly, the presence of detoxification-related genes like **UGT2B7** suggests liver cells.\n",
      "3. **Pancreatic Ductal Cells**: **CEACAM6** is often overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, suggesting a possible origin from pancreatic tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Most Likely Subtype\n",
      "The most likely subtype, based on the expression of **CEACAM6** and **UGT2B7**, is **Gastrointestinal Epithelial Cells**.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Analysis\n",
      "The marker list suggests an epithelial origin, with a strong indication towards gastrointestinal epithelial cells due to the presence of detoxification and cell adhesion markers.

      "- **Consistency with Identified Cell Type:** The markers VWF, EMCN, EGFL7, and PTPRB are well-known markers for endothelial cells, supporting the annotation of the cell type as endothelial cells. RAMP3 and ADGRL4 also support vascular signaling and endothelial cell function, further reinforcing this annotation.\n",

      "### Step 2: Mixed Cell Type Consideration\n",
      "- The annotation primarily supports a single cell type, endothelial cells, with a focus on vascular endothelial cells. The presence of markers like RAMP3 and ADGRL4, which can also be expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells, suggests a potential for mixed cell types. However, the strong presence of VWF, EMCN, and EGFL7 strongly supports the primary annotation of vascular endothelial cells.\n",
