The markers are consistently associated with neuronal cells, particularly sympathetic neurons.\n- There is no strong evidence of mixed cell types based on the provided markers.\n\n#### Confidence Assessment:\n- The markers listed are indeed associated with neuronal functions, and the annotation aligns well with the known roles of these genes.\n- However, the tissue type is prostate, which is not typically associated with a high abundance of neuronal cells, especially sympathetic neurons. This raises some concerns about the context of the tissue type and the proposed cell type.\n\nGiven the context of the tissue type (prostate) and the species (human), the annotation of sympathetic neurons seems less likely. Prostate tissue is more commonly associated with epithelial cells, stromal cells, and immune cells rather than neuronal cells. \n\n### Validation Result: VALIDATION FAILED\n### Confidence Score: 3\n\n### Feedback:\n- The annotation result is well-constructed and logically consistent with the marker genes provided. However, the context of the tissue type (prostate) does not align well with the proposed cell type (sympathetic neurons).\n- Re-evaluate the marker genes in the context of prostate tissue. Consider alternative cell types that are more commonly found in the prostate, such as epithelial cells, stromal cells, or immune cells.\n- Cross-reference the marker genes with databases and literature specific to prostate tissue to identify a more plausible cell type.\n- If neuronal markers are indeed present in prostate tissue, consider the possibility of nerve fibers or neuroendocrine cells, which can be found in the prostate but are less common."
